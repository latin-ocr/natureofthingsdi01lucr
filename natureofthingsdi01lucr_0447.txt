THE NATURE OFrTHINGS.

Or aught of equal lustre‚ would evince‚

The varying tinctures whence that lustre flows.

The diff’ ring forms, moreofer, the cube contains

Mar not its unity, but diff ’ring hues

A blended tinge create, by each divers’d.

A cause like this, too, all effect destroys ι

Since white or black springs not from seeds so dy’d,

But seeds commixt of various dyes possest.

Though, doubtless, white flows rather from the want

Of each existent tinctum, than from seeds

With black, in part, imbu’d,

or aught besides

Of equal contrast, and as firm a foe.

And, since all colours live but in the light,

Were hues essential to the seeds of things

the phaenomenon of white will be equally produced
by a skilful mixture of seven different powders, each
containing one of the seven prismatic colours enume-
rated above, and proportioned to each other, as the

seven differently coloured rays are found to be pro-

thcse experiments, instead of being a pure and perfect
white, will appear muddy, or as though intermixed
with some portion of black. Bodies, therefore, which
produce no alteration in a bearn of light, when thrown
upon them, but reflect all its colours equally, with-

portioned in a beam of light 3 or a circular piece of out absorbing any one, must inevitably appear white

card may be stained with distinct lines of the same
different hues, in the order in which they occur when
dividcd by a prism; and when swiftly twirled round
by a pin driven through its centre, the eye, from the
general intermixture of the colours that will necessarily
ensue, will perceive the whole assemblage converted
into a white. This white, however, will, in neither in-
stance, be perfectly pure3 for it is not easy to ap-
portion the colours to each other with precision, nor
can the colours themselves be supposed to possess the
vivacity of the natural and essential hues of the solar
rays. And hence the hue which is derived from

themselves: while those, on the contrary, that ab·
sorb the whole equally, and reflect no colour at
all, must give the appearance of black ; and thuS, by
destroying the light altogether, that impinges upon
their own sursace, must, as far as that sursace ex·
tends‚ produce the effect of total darkness. The
theory of Des Cartes on colours was not correct, but
he appears to have been the first philosopher who ra-
tionally accounted for the origin of the white and
black hues of bodies ε and, in this respect, hc has the
advantage of Lucretius.
