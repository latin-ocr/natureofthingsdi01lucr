Haud, ut opinor, enim mortalia secla superne

Nec mare, nec fluctus, plangentes saxa, crearunt3

Sed genuit tellus eadem, quae nunc alit ex se.

Most of my readers must be apprized that the poet,

in these verses, refers to the chain which Homer has

described in his Iliad, as connecting the earth with

the heavens, and from which gods and men rare alike

suspended z

lt is generally conjectured by the critics, how-
ever, that the terms carm χρυσειην, “the golden chain,”
are here only employed metaphorically. Plato, there-
fore, conceived, that under this figure the poet meaned
to represent the sun, whose animating influence, as
he travels through the ecliptic, connects and binds
the whole system together: while Macrobius asserts
it to typify the uninterruptcd chain of causes and
effects which are continually linked together through-
out the universe. In this last sense, Pope himself
appears to have understood it, if we may judge from
the parallel passage in his translation, which is rather
indeed a paraphrase than a literal version ; not a syl-
lable of the last of the two following lines being writ-
ten by Homer himself, excepting the word heaven :

Let down our golden everlasting chain,
those strong embrace holds heaven, and earth, and

fast by, hanging on a golden chain,
This pendent world. PAR, Losr, ii. 1051.

And it is an extraordinary fact, that many of the
modern Greeks, in the Archipelag0‚ and all the
kas, from the Musti to the peasant‚ still literally
believe that the earth, as well as the fixed stars, are
suspended from the seven heavens, of which they
conceive the etherial regions consist‚ by massy'and
everlasting chains. They likewise conceive, accord-
ing to the account given us by Mr. Eton, in his
‘⁴ Survey of the Turkish empire‚'' that the sun is a
vast ball of culinary fire, about as large as the whole
Ottoman province, and that the eclipses of the moon
are occasioned by a great dragon’s attempting to de-
vour this luminary.

The chain referred to by Lucretius, which reached
from heaven to earth, and conducted, according to
Homer, the race of gods, as well as the progenitors
of mankind, from the former to the latter, bears a
striking resemblance to the vision of the patriarch
Jacob in his journey to Padan-aram3 ‘⁴ And he
dreamed‚ and behold! a ladder set from the earth3
and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold!
the angels of God ascending and descending on it.”
Gen. xxviii. 12.

Milton, however, has clearly conceived the de· jectures that, in writing these verseS, Lucretius had

scription of Homer in its literal sense, as Lucretius
had done before him. For, with amanifest refer-
ence to the passage before us, he represents Satan as
looking towards the eternal throne, and beholding

in his mind that beautiful passage in the Iliad, in
which Patroclus upbraids Achilles on account of his
stern resentment against Agamemnon, and his obsti-
nate determination, not to engage any more in the
