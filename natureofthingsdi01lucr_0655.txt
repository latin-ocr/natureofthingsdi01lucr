What then has death, if death be mere repose,

THE NATURE OF THINGS.

And quiet only in a peaceful grave,
What has it thus to mar this life of man ?

Yet mar it does.

E’en o'er the festive board,

The glass while grasping, and, with garlands crown'd,

When healths go round, and kindly brimmers flow,
Till the fresh garlands on their foreheads glow,
They whine and cry, ‘⁶ Let us make haste to live ;
Short are the joys that human life can give !”
Eternal preachers Ξ who corrupt the draught,
And pall the god, who never thinks, with thought :
Ideots ! with all that thought, to whom the worst
Of death, is want of drink, and endless thirst.

Nothing was so common, amidst the festivals of
all ancient nations, as the introduction of wreaths or
garlands of flowers. In the nuptial ceremonies of the
Hebrews, the bridegroom was always encircled with
a costly ornament of this kind, which is the decora*
tion referred to by Isaiah in cap. lxi. 10. and in some
readings, is literally so rendered. It is also more
clearly designated in various places of the Psalms,
and especially in the Song of Songs. But, at other
feasts, as well as at the bridal banquet‚ a similar
chaplet was introduced : thus, in Lamentations‚
cap. v. 15.

The joy of our heart is ceased l

Our dance is turned into mourning!
The crown is fallen from our hemls!

Anacreon is perpetually alluding to the same cus-
tom ; and hence the following verses of Sophocles :

Ουτε (2⁸23 aaaaaa λικων
Νειμεν εμοι ρ-ᾦιν ὁμιλειν
Oua-s ’γλυκυ «υλων <nagor

AJAx FLAG.
By war disturb’d, the genial board
No longer will its sweets afford ;
Theirfiwgrant vdourr round my head
The vctuz'cml wm’aths rw longer spread ‚-

Nor musie's charms my soul delight.

Mr. Cumberland has hence, with much pro-
priety‚ decorated Belial with a similar chaplet, whom
Milton had before celebrated as the daemon of wine
and concupiscence :

 

around his temples twin'd

A wreath qfr·oses; and, where’er he pass’d,

His gai-ments· fanu’d a breeze osrich perfunic.

Among the Greeks and Romans, however, not
only the visitors themselves were encircled with gar-
lands of flowerS‚ but even the servants, and the gob-
lets as well. Thus, Homer:

Κρατηρως wrm-*responsuro ποτοιο :

 

Their flowing bowls they crown'd.
And Virgil:
Tum pater Anchises magnum cratera coronel.
Induit, implevitque mero.
Then round the bowl a roseat crown profuse
Anchises twin'd, and fill’d with sparklingjuicc.

At times, indeed, the floor itself of the room in
which the festive [rain assembled, was completely
strewed with roses and other odoi-ons flowers; and
Pliny expressly tells us, that this voluptuous cerc-
mony was adopted to dispel, by the fragrancy of
the perfume, that heaviness and stupefaction which
