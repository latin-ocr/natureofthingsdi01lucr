Pass, and repass through all th' immense of space:

ever be, the velocity of descent was, at au times,
equal: and that, of course, in passing through
space, the larger or more solid corpuscles could
never over-take the lighter. Hence Epicurus was
convinced, that, upon this theory, re-action and re-
silition must be totally impossible; for, as the pri-
mal atoms of matter could never reach each other in
a rectilinear course, they could never rebound, and
be thrown back into the sphere of action of atoms
still behind. And if it were possible to conceive
that, from such rectilinear motion alone, the com-
plex bodies of nature could in any way be produced,
(a motion that is perpetually fixed and unchangeable
in its operatiom) then must there be, in every in-
stance, a fixed necessity imposed‚ not only upon the
facts, and events of matter in general, but als'o upon
the thoughts, volitions, and actions of intelligent
beings; the soul itself being, upon their hypothe-
sis, as truly and essentially material as the exterior
world around it3 which moral necessity the atom-
ists, in general, did not chu'se to admit.

To remedy these defects and inconsistencies, to
avail himself of the advantages of the motion by rc-
action, and to preserve to the soul the power of
moral liberty, Epicurus conceived a third species of
motion3 and maintained, as will be found in the se-
quel of the present Book, that material atoms did
not perpetually descend in a direction strictly recti-
linear, but occasionally oscillated, the time and
place being alike uncertain, from a direct line,
though in the smallest degree possible: hei-chy be-
stowing a motion upon them, in no small degree,
similar to the oscillations of the magnetic needle.
And his motive for conceiving this oscillation to be
so extremely minute, producing, as Lucretius ob-
serves, a declination from a right line, but not an
obliquity, was, that otherwise he would have been
opposed by palpable, or at least, ostensible facts:
for every thing that descends‚ appears to the eye to
descend in aline perfectly direct: the deviation or cur-
vilinear motion wa8‚ therefore, supposed by Epicurus to
be so minute, as altogether to elude the power of vi«
sion. 'rhis additional motion to the system ofDemocri-

tus is thus noticed by Plutarch, and by him ascribed
solely to Epicurus: stlrnzprw, εν γενος τη,- ›amm-5147, 'ro καιτοι

ableto account, in a much more specious manner
than any who had preceded him, for the motion of
material atoms by re-action ς but it does not, in any
respect, appear calculated to solve the difficulties
concerning moral liberty, nor to administer to the
mind a greater degree of freedom than nature is
found to possess in any other department. For, if
the times and places in which primal seeds could
decline from a right line were, as Epicurus declared
they were, ever and alike uncertain, then must every
event around us, as well as every thought within
us, be altogether, and alike, contingent. If, on the
contrary, we remove the uncertainty, then must the
same necessity occur, which this addition is intended
to remove. Independently of which, the addition
itself was at best but a conjecture, and a conjecture
which the constant suecession of facts rather con-
troverted than supported: for, as Lucretius him-
self acknowledges, bodies never appear to the sight
to move otherwise than in a rectilinear direction.
On both these accounts, this hypothesis of Epi-
curus was opposed with much violence, and certain-
ly with some succesS, hythe immaterialists of the
Stoic and Platonic schools.

Among these antagonists Cicero appears to have
been one of its most formidable opponents3 auid,
from the friendship which subsistet} between himss
self and Lucretius, no man cau 'oe conceived to have
heard more urged in its favour than the former. His
books on “ the Nature of the Gods‚'’ and “on
Fate‚” are filled with arguments subversive of the
Epicurean theory. ‘⁶ What‚” observes he, ‘⁴ can
be the cause of such a declination, and why is not
such cause assigned ? If the rectilinear motion of ma-
terial atoms springs from gravity, why has not Epi-
curus told us by what means other atoms are freed
from this common bond? Have they cast lots among
themselves, or by what other means liare ther rnu-
