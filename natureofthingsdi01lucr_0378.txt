F ulgur ubi ad coelum se tollit, totaque circum

AEre renidescit tellus; subterque, virum vi,

Excitur pedibus sonitus, clamoreque montes

Ictei rejectant voces ad sidera mundi;

Et circum volitant equites, mediosque repente

Transmittunt, valido quatientes inpete, campos:

Et tamen est quidam locus altis montibus, unde

Stare videntum et in campis consistere fulgur.

Nunc age, jam deinceps cunctarum exordia rerum,

Qualia sint, et quam longe distantia formis,

Percipe3 multigenis quam sint variata figuris :

As when the legion o’er the plain afar

Unfolds its spreading cohorts rang’d for war;

When, opposite in arms, the squadrons stand,

And gleaming steel wide waves o’er all the land, &c.

The narrow space to which the Spartans were
confined at the battle of Thermopylae‚ has not al·
lowed our own countryman, Glover, to introduce the
latter part of the imagery selected by Virgil ; but he
has thus described the former :

As o’er the main
In lucid rows the rising waves ressect
The sun's effulgence‚ so the Grecian heims
Return'd his light, which o’er their convex
pour'd,
And scatter’d splendour on the dancing plumes.
Leomrms, b. iv.

It may not be unentertaining to my readers, to
have an opportunity of comparing, with these de-
scriptions, a somewhat parallel passage in the Spanish
poet Lope de Vega. He is painting a rencountre
between the Spaniards and the Moors; and the
richncss of dress, exhibited by both parties, enables
him to introduce an original simile.

Como en el triangular cristal se mira.
De varios y diversos tomasoles,
Campo, cielo, ciudad, ¹o mar 3 y admira
Ver tan diversos nubes, y arreboles ς
Assi la esquadra que entra y se retia,
De Moros Africanos, y Espafioles
A la vista, que juntos confundian,
Jardin florido en Mayo parecian.
Hmmosmm m: Auamma, Cant. ι’.

As in the crystal prism th’ observer views

Heaven‚ earth, and ocean blend their various
hues,

And crowded towns—while still the splendours
ἢν

Still stit, perpetual, through each rain-bow dyc—-

Advancing thus, thus yielding o’er the plain,

The Moorish squadrons blend, and pride of
Spain : λ

Thus intermingled, in confus'd array,

Rich as a garden in the mouth of May.

This descriptionis, for aught I know original; but
I must not omit to quote the close and beautiful
copy from Lucretius, that occurs in the third Canto
of the Lusiad, and affor-ds us, in the Por-tuguese‚
