Atque aliud porro, nigrum quom, et caetera, sentit3

Nec refert, ea, quae tangis, quo forte colore

Praedita sunt, verum quali magis apta figur&

Scire licet, nihil principiis opus esse colores,

Sed variis formis Varianteis cdere tactus.

Praeterea, quoniam non certis certa figuris

Est natura coloris, et omnia principiorum

Formamenta queunt in quo vis esse nitore:

Quur ea, quae constant ex illis, non pariter sunt

sitzgly imperceptible bodies must come from them to the
eyes, and thereby convey to the hrain some motion
which produces these ideas, which we have of them
iu us.

‘⁶ After the same manner that the ideas of these
original qualities are produced in us, we may con-
ceive, that the ideas of secondary qualities are also
produced, viz. by the operation os insensible particles

on our senses. For it being manifest that there are

bodies, and good store of bodies, each whereof is so
small that we cannot, by any of our senseS, discover
either their bulk‚ figure, or motion, as is evident in the
particles of the air and water, and others extremely
smaller than those, perhaps as much smaller than the
particles· of air οι· water, as the particles of air
or water are smaller than peas or hail-stones: let
us suppose at present, that the different motions and
figures, bulk and number, of such particles affecting
