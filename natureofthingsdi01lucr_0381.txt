Boou Π, THE NATURE OF THINGS. ‘233

Of equ'al figureS, oft unlike they meet.

Nor wond’rous this, since, such th’ abundance form’d,

No bounds can chain, no numbers e'er compute.

Hence, not unfrequent, each from each, through space, 345

Must meet diverse, unkindred in their frames.

Thus nature varies ; man, and bruta] beasr‚

And herbage gay, and silver fishes mute,

And all the tribes of heav’n, o'er many a sea,
*Through many a grove that wing, or urge their song 3 50
Near many a bank of fountain, lake, or rill,

Search where thou wilt, each differs in his kind,

In form, in figure differs. Hence alone,

Knows the fond mother her appropriate young,

Th’ appropriate young their mother, mid the brutes, 3 55
As clear discern'd as man's sublimer race.

Thus oft before the sacred shrine, perfum'd

With breathing frankincense, th' affrighted calf

Pours o'er the altar, from his breast profound‚

The purple fiood of life. But wand’ring wild 360
O'er the green sward, the dam, bereft of hope,

Tunc piget ire domum, mcestoque novissima campo Seizes, or cruel swain for rites divine νὴ

Exit, et appositas impasta avertitur herbas. The dam, bereft, now fills the vallies, now
ΤΗΕΒ. lib. vi. 186. The floods, the woodlands‚ with her lond larnents,
As when the calf, defrauded first of milk, Her young demanding of each desert spot.
Of tottering limb, and all his life-blood drawn Slowtreads she homewards——slow—but,once ζωὴ-Ἄ,
From the sweet uddcr‚ some voracious beast Flies the sad scene, and spuma th' umas-ted grusz.
