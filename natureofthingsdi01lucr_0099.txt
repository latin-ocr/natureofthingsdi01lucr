THE LIFE OF LUCRETIUS. lxxxv

An incorruptible soul, however, being thus generally conceived to
constitute a portion os the human frame, it became, from a very early
period, necessary to inquire into the partit was destined to perform
while connected with the body. And from its being admitted on all
hands, by those who denied, as well as by those who contended for its>
incorruptibility, to be of a inore volatile and attenuate nature than the
body properly so called, it required no great degree of acuteness to
appropriate to it, as its peculim· prerogathe, the principle of thought
and consciousness ; or to maintain consecutively, that thought or con-
sciousncss could not result from pure elementary matter under any
combination. It is commonly iniagined that this latter tenet was the
foundation of the former; but whoever examines the history of man·
kind will perceivc that the idea of an immortal or incorruptible soul
was very generally accredited for ages before the science of metaphy-
sics or psychology was heard of, or even conceived; and the parent

is hence transmuted into the offspring.

Such was the general belief in the age of Epicu1·uS‚ and such it con-
tinued to be in the time of Lucretius; and hence it was necessary to
reduce the doctrine to the crucible of minute exainination and experi-
ment, in order to ascertain its veracity. This each of them appears to
hare done with a precision that scarcely leaves a wish ungratified, and
the result is, admitting their reasoning to be cor-rect, that the frame of
man is simple, uncompounded matter; that matter, in its gross and
cruder state, composes the body, and in its inore refined οι· gaseous,

the soul or spirit,

That rears th' incipient stimulus, and first

Has modern science added any thing to this discovery, οι· rests the
question as handed down to us in the pages of Lucretius? The Chris„
