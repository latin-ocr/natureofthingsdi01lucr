THE NATURE OF THINGs‚

And only thus, as form'd from various seeds,

To all things common, but in various modes

Τ he glitten-ing poetry of Dr. Darwin affords nu-
merous instances of the same decoration; pursued,
in some casm, to excess. The following couplet, and I
have no room for more, offers us an elegant and un-
exceptionable example:

Organic forms with chemic changes strive,
Live but to die, and cz‘ie but to revive-

Tssmr. οι·- Nm. ii. 48.

Perhaps no poet, however, of real talents, in our own
language, hm: carried this figure to so blame-able an
excess, as Dr. Young in his Night Thoughts, where
it certain& makes its appearance too frequently,
and is nursi-ru, in most instanees, too far.

Let =
knowt . ,Ar-d abilizy‚ both ancient and modern, in

ow examine a few foreign poets of ae-

confirmation of t'ne taste of the poet before us.
And first, the eclogues of Virgxl are full of the
anaphora‚—full, I mean, without producing dis-

gust. Let us take an example from his Pollio :

Pan etiarn, Arcadia mecum si judice certet,
Pan etiam, Arcadia dicat se jndice victum.

To this passage the judicious Vida has referred,
as a proof of the beauty of the iterative figure, and
its employment by poets of unrivalled reputation-
These are his words, and this his own imitation of
this very couplet:

Qid sequar ulterius quanta dulcedine captus
Detineant aures, vocem cum rursus eandem
Ingeminant, modo non verborum cogat egestas?
Pan etiam Arcadia neget hoc si judice praesens,
Pan, etiam Arcadia dicam te judice vanum.
Ροετ. iii. 142.
But now to mention farther l forbear-
With what strong charms they captivate the
ear ;
When the same terms they happily repeat,
The same repeated seem more soft and sweet.
This, were Arcadia judge, if Pan withstood‚
Pan's judge‚ Arcadia, would condemn her
god.

Homer himself furnishes us with almost as many
instances as Virgil. Let the following suffice ε
Φραξκντες ἓηρυ Σουρει, (3an7- βακει προὲελυμειω·
Aer-‘ms αῤ ooo-mh* emaS÷, κορυς maior, ompx δ’ ανηρ.
IL. N. 130.
This passage has been happily imitated by Sta-
tius, and without swelling the present note unne-

cessarily, with quotations from the poets of Greece
and Rome, I will confine mysclf to this instance alone z

Jam clypeus clypeis, umbone repellitur umbo,

Ense minax ensis, pede pes, et cuspide cuspis.
THEn. viii.

Pope has been equally fortunate in his version of

the above passage in Homer, and it will serve as a
translation of either extract:

Au iron scene gleams dreadful o'er the fields,
Armour in armour lock’d, and shields in shields ;

Spears lean on spears, on targets targets throng,
Helm sticks to helm, and man drivcs man along.

In an Ode on Painting, by Frederic Staiidlin‚
a German poet of no small merit of the present day,
the same description and figure is so precisely in-
troduced as to require no additional translation.

Hier, wie im grausen schlachtgefild
An panzer panzer haut,

Und belm an helm, und schild an schild,
Und dampf von leichen wallt,

An alliteration of the same kind is to be met with
in the twelfth Canto of the Jerusalem Delivered z

L’ onta irrita lo sdegno alla vendetta ;
E la vendetta poi l‘ onta rinnova :
Onde sempre al ferir, sempre alla fretta
Stimol novo s’ aggiunge, e cagion nova.

Alternate furies either breast inflame,
Alternate vengeance, and alternate shame;

No pause, no rest th' impatient warriors know,
But rage to rage, and blow succeeds to blow.

Sir John Fanshaw has introduced a beautiiiitioalllxi:

teration into his version of the second canto of the
