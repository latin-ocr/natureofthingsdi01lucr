DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. II.

Praeterea, cunctas itidem res vortere sese t

Vortunt se fluviei in frundeis‚ et pabula laeta

In pecudes ; vortunt pecudes in corpora nostra

Naturam; et nostro de corpore saepe ferarum

Augescunt vireS‚ et corpora pennipotentum.

Ergo omneis natura cibos in corpora viva

Vortit‚ et hinc'sensus animantum procreat omneis:

Non alia} longe ratione, atque arida ligna

Explicat in flammas, et in igneis omnia vorsat.

Et conmixta quibus dent motuS, adcipiantque ?

Quod movet, et varios sensus expromere cogit3

the atmospheoe, ani hence deposited on the waters or
putrefactions where they were generated. But the

idea 3 and these have since been confirmed by some

very curious and important ones by M. Pati-in, who

discovered vegetables.

Dr. Darwin, who never suffered a system to lose any
thing, when once imbibed by himself, seems to have
carried this of spontaneous vitality to a most immo-
derate extreme. The reader may form some idea of
its extravagance from the following pzissage with
which he concludes one of his essays upon this sub-
ject. “ But it may appear too bold, in the present
state of our knowledge on this subject, to suppose
that all vegetables and animals now mining, were
originally derived from the smallest microscopic ones

formed by spontaneous vitality ; and that they have,
