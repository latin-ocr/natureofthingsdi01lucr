Muralique caput summum cinxere corone,

Eximiis munita locis quod subtinet urbeis:

Quo nunc insigni per magnas praedita terras

Horrifice fertur divinae Matris imago.

Hanc variae genteS‚ antiquo more sacrorum, ·

Idaeam vocitant matrem3 Phrygiasque catervas

Dant comites, quia primum ex illis finibus edunt

Ver. 612. And, with a mura! crown her brows they
bound,

Since with ker tow'rs she guardi- man’s civic
rights] That her temples, in this grand
exhibition, were guarded with this mural wreath or
coronet, is still further confirmed by the following
lines of Virgil :

 

qualis Berecynthia mater
Invehitur curru Phrygias turrita per urbes.
L. vi. v. 784.

 

in pomp she makes the Phrygiam round
With golden turrets on her temples crown’d.
Darnru.

Ovid has likewise recorded the same fact, and
offered the same explanation:

At cur turrita caput est ornata corona ?
An Phrygiis turres urbibus illa dedit ἶ FAST. iv,

But with a crown of turrets why bedeck’d?
Is it that turrets she to Phrygia taught ?

The Greeks and Romans were accustomed, on
public occasions, to distribute wreaths or coronets of
a variety of forms to citizens of distinguished merit
of every kind: the decoration varying according to
the species of merit exhibited. The Corona Muralis2
of which our poet is here speaking, was bestowed by
the commander in chief, as a mark of honour on the
soldier who first scaled the walls of a besieged town.

It was composed of gold, and ornamented with em-
brasures, in imitation of the battlements of fortified
walls or towers: affording a happy emblem οἱ the
right which every distinct city or state has to regulate
its own political constitution, and to resist any hostile
attempt or encroachment on the part of its neigh-
bours.

Our own poet Denham has here not unaptly com-
pared the scenery of spires and battlements around
Windsor to this imperial diadem :

A crown qs such mzy‘estic towers does grace
The gods’ great mother, when her heavenly race

Do homage to her.
Coormt's Hir-1u

Ver. 616. Her many α state, from holiest legends, call
Parent ofInA, and with Pnavcmn nymphs]

I have already observed, that there were two moun-
tains of much celebrity thus denominated among the
Greeks. One was in Phrygia, at a short distance
from Troy, on the brow of which Paris is said to
have adjudged the golden apple to Venus: and the
other in the island of Crete, where was the immediate
residence of the priests of ‘⁶ This mighty mother of
both gods and men‚’' who were named Curetes, but
who were themselves of Phrygian descent‚ and to
whom our poet adverts in ver. 639. In either place,
therefore, this Idaean deity may have been supposed
to have peculiarly resided-
