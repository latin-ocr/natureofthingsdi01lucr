Search where thou wilt, an INCORPOREAL vom,
This mark, and half philosophy is thine.
Doubtful no longer shalt thou wander: taught

Th’ entire of thingS‚ and by our verse convine'd.

And know this vom is SPACE UNTOUCH’D and PURE.

Space, or void, is, in the present day, Ι believe,
universally assented to ; and seems to be demonstrated
by the best chemical experiments. M. de la Place
has long asserted, that the molecules of bodies are
infinitely larger than the diameter of these mole-
cules ; and, among other demonstrations, has appealed
to the extreme sacility with which the rays of light
penetrate transparent substances in every direction.
And M. Haiiy, who espouses the same doctrine,
has advanced proofs still more decisive, from the
symmetrical arrangement of the molecules of various
natural bodies in a state of crystalization. See his
Traite 'Elementaire de Physique, lately published at
Paris3 a work well worth consulting by every one
who is attached to the science of natural philosophy.

Ver.380. Andknow this vomis srAcE unroucn'n
and ruam] The original of this verse,
which is certainly nnnecessary, and in the original
sti-angely unconnected, has been condemned in strong
terms by Bentley and Wakefield. The latter has,
therefore, as will be found in the opposite page, in-
cluded it in brackets 3 and advanced a conjecture, that
it was at first nothing more than a mere marginal re-
ference ‘of an ancient transcriber, which, at length,
forced its uncouth way into the text itself.

Ver. 381. W ere srAcr. like this vouchsaf ’d not, nought
could move :] It was not the Epicureans alone,

but the Pythagoreans, and many other sects of phi-t
losophers, who contended for the existence of a va-
cuum: a dogma first introduced among men of let-
ters, either by Democritus or Leucippus, the founders
of the atomic school. Laertius, therefore, speaking
of the former of these philosophers, asserts, δοκε αυτ-μ
τοδε αρχας tirou w& ὅλων σιτομους και ’uror ε “ It appeared
to him, that atoms‚ and a vacuum, were the principles
of all things.”
the doctrine of Democritus; and though he allowed
and contended strenuously for the existence ofa void,
he did not admit that void to be a principle ofthings,

Epicurus, however, improved upon

maintaining it tohafford nothing more than a mere
place for the principles of things, which were solid,
to exist in. He likewise added the property of weight
to those of magnitude and figure: and, conceiving
that the vortices, or regular rontines of motion, in
which, according to Democritus, all material atoms
proceeded, constituted a necessity fatal to all moral
liberty, and indispensably reduced the human soul to
a mere machine, he discarded them from his creed3
and, to the perpendicular and reflexive motions al-
lowed by atomic philosophers in general, he intro-
duced a third ς and supposed that atoms, or the seeds
of things, had an extraordinary· power of declining
from a right line, and moving spontaneonsly, and
without collision or impetus, in an oblique or curvili-
near direction. From which alteration, as will be more
fully explained in the second book of this pt em, he ima.
gined he obtained a foundation for moral election.
