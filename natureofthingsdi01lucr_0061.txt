THE LIFE OF LUCRETIUS. xlvii

to have gone out of that medium in which the most perfect produc-
tions are. found, and to be guilty of some¹excess in these opposito cha-
racters. Of all the great poets‚ Virgil and Racine, in my opinion, lie
nearest the centre, aud are the farthest removed from both the ex-

tremities *ᾗ

To this honourable testimony of ΜΓ. Humc, the reader must excuse
my recurring to the equally advantageous opinio-n of Dr. W⁷a1·t011;
than whom no scholar was ever better acquainted with Lucretius, and
no critic more competent to decide upon his merits. ‘⁶ 1 ain next‚'’ says
he, “to speak of Lucretius, whose merit, as a poet, has never yet
been sufficiently displayed, and who seems to have had more fire,
spirit, and energy‚ more of the vivida vis (mimi, than any of the Roman
poets, not excepting Virgil himself. XVhoever imagines, with Tully †·‚
that Lucretius had not a great genius, is desired to cast his eye 011
two pictures he has given us at the beginning of his poem: the first
of Venus with her lover Mars, beautiful to the last degree ζζ, and more
glowing than any picture painted by Titian 3 the second ᾗ, of that ter-
rible and gigantic figure, the daemon of superstition, worthy the ener-
getic pencil of Michael Angelo. Neither do I think, that the descripss
tion that immediately follows, of the sacrifice of Iphigenia, was
excelled by the famous picture of Timanthes on the samo subject, of
which Pliny speaks so highly, in the thirty-fifth book of liis Natural
History: especially the minute ancl moving circumstance of her per-
ceiving the grief of her father Agememnon, and of the priest’s con-
cealing his sacrificing knife, and of the spectators bursting into tears,
and her falling on her knces. Few passages, even 111 vii-gil himself,

nion of Tully‚ but quite the contrary. Dr. VVarton refers to the common, but erroncous reading, and a
reading-which is now, 1 believe, universally relinquished for that Ι have given in p. xliv.
