tation‚ had, at this time, the hardihood to intermix the atomio philo·
sophy with the tenets of the Christian saith. Sennert, an eminent phy-
sician at Wirtemburg‚ publishecl an express elucidation and defenee of
the atomic system, in a work entitled, Hypomnemata Physica, ‘⁶ Heads
of Physics ἦ ;” Vives and Rarnus ventured publicly to expose the defects
of the Aristotelian philosophy, and Chrysostom Magneni, who pub-
lished ‘⁶ A Treatise on the Life and Philosophy of Democritus †·, at-
tempted to reconcile the systems of the Peripatetics and the Atomists ;
a vain effort, however, and which 116 was obliged to relinquish. Mag-
neni was an Italian, and the poets of Italy appear to have taken, atithe
same time, as much pains to restore the atomio system as the philoso-
phers themselves. Hence Michele Milani wrote a very long and
learned canzone, in which he unequivocally asserts, that it was pur-
posely meant to adapt a great part of the atomio hypothesis to the
Christian verity ᾗ. His example was followed by Baptista Guarini,
who also wrote a book in favour of the same school ξ ; and shortly af-
terwards by Francisco de QuevedQ a Spanish poet and philosopher 11,
and by our own countryman, Sir William Temple ql.

But the 17th century presented us with two Epicureans, of far more
celebrity than any of these : I mean Gassendi and Du Rondelle3 both
natives of France, and both of whom laboured witli more assiduity and
critical investigation to establish the moral character of the founder of
this school, and the truth of his fundamental doctrines, than any of its
adherents from the era of Diogenes Laertius.

Of these two accurate critics and elaborate scholars, Gassendi has

acquired the greater share of reputation z for he not only wrote a bio-
