over, that the first efforts of this chaos, towards the
production of order and harmony, consisted in the
gradual separation of clement from clement, accord-
ing to its comparative gravity : that air would
therefore be superior in the scale of ascentq next
water, and then earth. He again supposes, that
this separation of clement from clement, was the
work of a vast series of time, and that, consequently‚
no short period must have,elapsed before the forma-
tion ofanimals or vegetables destined to inhabit the dry
and continental parts of the earth. But as this was not
necessary with respect to marine anmals, he conceives
these latter to have been the first race of beings pro-
duced in the order ofcreation ε and he hence accounts
for the frequency with which we meet with exuvies of
such auimals as also with fossi] shells, and other
marine relics on the highest mountains, and in a va-
riety of places where we should not expect them.
The operation of the sun and moon upon the agitated
chaotic mam, by drawing the waters away from one
part towards another, would allOW‚ between every
tide, a sufficient period for the upper points of land,
not hurried away by the stream, to harden and resist
the tide's return, or rise superior to its influx. These
points or summits‚ which would be constantly in..
creasing, would at length become proper habitations
for man and beast, and vegetables ; and to these ele-
vations of land he gives the appellation of Primitive
lslands.—This theory does not explain the origin of
craggy rocks, profound vallies, and volcanic lavas.
But, to account for such later phaenomena, the inge-
nious author refers us to the universal deiuge ς which

 

he conceives to have been produced by the expansive
operation of a large body of subterranean fire, which,
bursting the solid contents of the globe to its surface,
admitted, through a vast variety of chasms, immense
quantities of water from the general bed of the ocean,
which, rarefied, in its turn, by the subterranean hear
to which it was exposed, concurred‚ by its elastic
force, in the productiori of all the diversities of
height and depth, of rough and smooth‚ that are
exhibited in the variegated face of nature. M. de
Saussure appears to have entertained very similar
ideas. He was, therefore, in the language of the
French philosophers, a Neptunian: and it was his
intention at one time to have delivered his opinions
upon the primitive state of the earth, in a full and
explicit manner. But, notwithstanding all his geolo-
gie knowledge, and profound investigations, the more
he meditated upon this subject, the more difficult‚ ht-
declared, it appeared to him, to form a decided opi-
nion ς and he died without having accomplished the
object he had in view.
