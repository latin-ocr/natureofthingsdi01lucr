DE RERUM NATURA.

Nam multis subcensa locis ardent sola terrae3

Eximiis vero furit ignibus inpetus AEtnae.

Tum porro nitidas fruges, arbustaque laeta,

Gentibus humanis habet unde extollere possit:

Unde etiarn fluidas frundeis, et pabula laeta,

Montivago generi possit praebere ferarum 3

Qua re magna desim mater, materque ferarum,

Et nostri genetrix haec dicta est corporis una.

verses in the Hymn of Orphms, in which Barth,
herself, is represented as speaking:

Ex σου 'ycxp και Ὑακι, και ουρανος supe: υπερέε,

Και worm„ πνοιφιι τε.

Mother of gods and moi-tal men, on me

Th‘ expansive heavens above, the fields below,
And airs, and seas depend.

And equally in point, as well as more generally il-
lustrative, are the verses that follow from the cele-
brated Hymn to Cybele, attributed to Homer:

The deification of the Earth is differently ac-
counted for: ΜΓ. Bryaut's system ἱε, perhaps, after
all, the most plausible, though it wants a foundation,
and is, in other respects, too fanc'zful, especially
in its etymologics. The reader will find a more ge-
neral account of it in the note on ver. 1167 of this
book. According to this hypothesis, the idolatry of
