a contrary opinion, and condemns the dogma, thus ad-
vanced, as pregnant with audacity and impiety (audac-
ter et impie affirmat, ἃς.) Bnt what then, it may be
asked, is the uninterrupted object of all human pur-
suits, if it be not pleasure or happiness? For what
,other end do mankind either engage in toil, or desist
from it altogether ? Why, else, do they either cling
to life, or free themselves from it by suicide ? Why,
but from a hope of obtaining some degree, at least,
of comparative ease or happiness, or pleasure, or un-
der whatever other title may bc ranked

That the unisorm and perpetual pnrsuit of man is
pleasure, is a truth which, if duly considered, can-
not but be acknowledged by the severest moralist‚ and
the most gloomy enthusiast. Young, in his ‘⁴ Night
ThonghtS‚'' therefore, is not more poetical than ac-
curate, when he asserts‚ that

Pleasure’s the mistress of th’ etherial powers ς

For her contend the rival gods above.

Pleasure’s the mistress of the world below:

1th bc cbserved, that pleasures vary to infinitude

in their kinds and objects; and that, while some
may be pure and praise-worthy, others, most cer·
tainly, are vile and contemptible—I admit the fact.
It is, however, still universally true, that the pur-suit
of all mankind is pleasure; and it is equally true,
that the peculiar species of pleasure encouragedv by
our poet is, in every respect, consistent with virtue,
and the dignity of man. In the present instance,
the pleasure immediately referred to by him, is Iove,
or sexuul cff‘ction .· but surely, it is possible to refer
to a passion thus univer-sally seated in the heart of
every created being, without incurring the charge
either os impiety or impurity. Lucretius, as a poet,
deifies this passion, following the example of every
poet who preceded him. D’Avenant, in his Gondi-
bert, does the same: and where is the harm in repre-
senting the virtuous and temperate soldiers of this
prinee as yielding to the force of Love, when, in the
form of Beauty, they beheld her pass by with her
virgin-train ? These are his words:
They vayled their ensigns as it by did move,
