Part, of primordial atoms uncombin’d‚

Epicurean philosophy; and conceiving that he has
established the existence of matter and space, and de-
monstrated that no other principle whatever can be de·
tected throughout the Universe, he next advances
that matter is composed of two kinds, elementary
atonis, impenetrably solid and compat, and sub-
stances compounded of such atoms with certain pro-
portions of vacuum, consequently unsolid and porous.
The elementary atoms of matter, he contends, must
be solid, as being the precise converse of vacuum,
and having no common property with it; that va-
cuum itself could not be proved to exist, or measurcd
as to its extent, if it were not bounded by solid sub-
stances; and that, thus, they mutually demonstrate
the existence of each other.

These primal or solid atoms are the ultima, as the
poet afterwards endeavours to demonstrate, or small-
est badies of actual existence. The mind, undoubte
edly, may conceive of bodies more minute, for it may
conceive of these micutest substances of actual exist-
enee as divided, and as infinitely divisible. But our
philosophie bard attempts to prove (ver. 67 5.) that if
we admit the doctrine of au infinite physical divisibi-
lity, or, in other words, do not contend for an ex-
treme into which bodies may be divisible‚ and beyond
which they cannot be divided, the grossest absurdi-
ties must follow. Every thing would, in this case,be

infinite alike‚ as possessed of infinite parts; and it
would, as in a variety of instances it has done in mo-
dern times, lead us to the total disbelief of matter of any
kind ς and to become pupils of Spinoza, Hobbs‚ Berk-
ley, or Hume, according as the collateral tenets of
these philosophers principallyinfluenced ourjudgment.

The supposition, that these primal atoms were the
least or ultimate bodies of existing nature, was an im-
provement upon the system of Democritus, and a
doctrine peculiar to the Epicurean school. Thus
Dionysius observes, as quoted by Eusebius, Praep.
xiV. 7. τοσουτον &wore-rou οσονὸ μεν ελαχιστας πασας και
35oe τουτο ανξπαῦσθῆτου, ὃ δε Δημοκρῦτθς, και μξΎόσἼας §Hm
τινας ωτομους υπελαέεη “ they disagreed in as much
as the atoma of Epicurus were all least and ulti-
mate, and therefore insensible ς whilst Democritus
conceived many of them to be of considerable magni-
tude.'' And Heraclitus, therefore, who adhered to
the old atomio school, has, occasionally‚ denomina-
ted these latter ογκους, tumid, or massy-

But atoms that are perfectly solid are indissoluble,
and can never be separated. Such atoms, must,
therefore, exist for ever, and without change: they
must be eternal, and immutable. These properties
of matter, properties I mean attributed to it by the
Epicureans, our philosophie poet discusses at ver⁴
581 and 604.
