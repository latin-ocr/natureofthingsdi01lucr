DE RERUM NATURA.

Lrss. 111.

Non tam se moriens dissolvi conquereretur3

Sed magis ire foras, vestemque relinquere, ut anguis

[Gauderet, praelonga senex aut cornua cervus.]

Denique, quur animi numquam mens, consiliumque,

615

Gignitur in capite, aut pedibus, manibusve ; sed unis

Sedibus, ac certis regionibus, omnibus haeret;

Ver. 624. Charm’d to throw cgff his vestare, like the

snake,] This phaenomenon of the exfoliation

of the squammce, or external cuticle of the snake, on

the return of Spriug, is noticed by most natural his-
torians. Virgil alludes to it in the following lines:

Qalis ubi in lucem coluber, mala gramina pastus,
Frigida sub terra tumidum quem bruma tegebat ;
Nunc positis novus exuviis, nitidusque juventa,
Lubrica convolvit sublato pectore terga
Arduus ad solem, et linguis micat ore trisulcis.
AEntm ii. 471.
So shines, renew'd in youth, the crested snake.
Who slept the winter in a thorny brake ;
And casting (fil-«is slough‚ when spring returns,
Now looks aloft, and with new glory burns.
Restm-’d with poisonous herbs, his ardent sides
Reflect the sun, and rais'd on spires he rides :
High o'er the grass he hissing rolls along,
And brandishes, by sits, his forky tongue.
Davum.

With this the reader may compare the description
of Avitus, which, if I be not much mistaken, is pos-
sessed of equal beauty:

Qialis vere novo, primis cum mensibus aestas
Praemittit laetos post frigora pigra tepores,
Evadens veterem reparatis motibus annum,

Et siccum nitido discingens corpore tegmen,
Procedit coluber; terrarumque abdita linquens
Praefert terribilis metuendum formae decorem-

II. 126.

 

 

As when, in spring, returning beat prevails,

And leads o’er brumal snows, the tepid gales,

Fostering the face of Nature ;——from the brake

XVhe-n, with new vigour, bursts the polish’d
snake,

Clear'd of his spoils, and eager to display

His fearful beauties in the eye of day—

Pliny seems to have conceived‚ that this exfolia-
tion of the exuviae, or squammose tunic of the snake
did not occur annually‚ but only upon the advance
of age ; and that the serpent hereby, as though dis-
encumbered ofa burden, acquired, even then, a con-
siderable re-possession of alacrity and vigour. Hist.
Nat. cap. viii. But later naturalists have notieed the
same fact as regularly recurring every spring, and in
some species of the coluber or viper, every spring
and autumn ς and so complete is the cuticle exsoli-
ated‚ that even the external tunic of the eye is thrown
off at the same time. snakes, however, are not the
only animala that suffer an annual loss and renovation
of some part os their organic structure. Our poet
alludes, in the adjoining verse, to the yearly exsoli-
ation and renewal of the antlers of the stag: and it
js now well known, that the lobster, and indeed, al-
most all the cancer genus, as well as the common
spider‚ and many other insects of the Linne‘an class,
Aptera, part with their external crustaceous coat-
ing every year, generally between the months of May
and August 3 and are capable of regenerating a limb

or claw with great ease, upon losing it by acci-
dent. ⁷
