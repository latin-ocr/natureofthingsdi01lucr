THE NATURE OF THINGS.

Here, too, is Sisyphus—the man who pants

For public honours, and the giddy crowd

Caresses ever, ever but in vain.

For thus to toil for power, itself at best

A bubble, and that bubble ne’er to boast,

1035

Yet still toil on——is doubtless to roll back,

Up the high hill, the huge, stern, struggling stone;

That which, the steep peak once urg'd up, rebounds

Rapid, resistless, all over the plain.

T hen, too, to feed th’ ungrateful mind, and fill

With every good, while still it craves for more,

(As feed mankind the seasons in their turn,

*vVith fruits, and endless beauties, while themselves

Still riot on, and never have enough)

This, or I err, the fable well ⁴unfolcls,

'nard inserted in this place for a comparison. It is
well observed by Mr. Wakefield, that Lucretius,
with a view of rivalling him, has exerted his utmost
efforts, and poured forth anthe powers of diction,
and all the artifice of pause and numbers. Nor have
his exertions been void of success. To re-quote him
is useless: his description extends in the text from
ver. 1008, to v. ποις.

The similar picture in Homer, is as follows :

Kou μην Σισυφον mador, ›tpoe‘rep' (1.).γέ εχοντα,
Λααν βαρτοιζοντοι πελωριον αμφοτεςησιν·

Η τοι ὁμεν, σκηριπτομενος χερσι τε τοο-ι τε,
Δααν ww &Osa-ns ποτι λοφον” αλλ’ ὅτε μελλοι
Λκρον ιῖπερςαλεειν, τοτ’ αποςτρεψασκε upa-rou* ις
Αυτις· wrm-rx πεὲονδε κυλινδετο λαας asangm.

On. Β. 594.

The rapidity of the last line in Homer scarcely
surpasses that of Lucretius, and the difficulty of the
toil expressed in the antecedent verse, not much.
Lucretius has adopted precisely the sudden pause of
Homer, prior to the change of the numbers. As to
the translation of Pope, l by no means aspire to
equal it: it becomes me, however, to insert it, al—
though, undoubtedly, to my own disadvantage ι

Ι turn'd my eye, and, as I turn'd‚ survey'd

A mournful vision ! the Sisyphian shade 3

With many a weary step, and many a grean,

Up the high hill he heaves a huge round stone ;

The huge round stone, resulting with a bound,

Thunders impetuous down, and smokes along th:
ground.
