THE NATURE OF THINGS.

In both erroneous, and with those deceiv'd

Class'd in our numbers, and oppos’d above,

male in the ovarium or uterus of the female3 which
was a mere nidus for its evolution and perfect
growth. In fither case, however, the rudimen-
tum homunculi, οι· the minute embryon, was sup-
posed to be possessed of every limb and feature, or
the rudiments of every limb and feature, that the
human frame exhibits when in a state of perfectiori.
It was in allusion to this last doctrine, to which
indeed he appears to have been a complete prose-
lyte, that Sir R. Blackmore wrote the following
lines in his “ Creat1'0n:”

When the crude embryo careful Nature breeds,

See how she works, and how her work pro·
ceeds ς

While thro’ the mass her energy she darts

To free and swell the complicated partS,

Which οηζγ does unravel and untwist

Th’invelop’d limbs that previous there exist. B. 6.

Perrault advanced far beyond this doctrine of
evdlution3 and maintained that, strictly speaking,
there is no such thing as new generati0n in any order
of beings: that the Almighty created all things in
the beginning3 and that what we term generations
are only augmentations or expansions of the minute
parts of the bodies of seeds. So that every order,
class, and species of every thing that has existed,
does exist, or will exist hereaster, were all really
formed at first, and inclosed in such secde, to be
brought forth and unfolded to view at definite times,
and according to definite arrangements. Perrault
appears, completely, therefore, to have imbibed the
old philosophy of Anaxagoras, without knowing it ς
or, if he knew it, at least, without acknowledg-
ing it.

Whilst upon this subject, 1 cannot avoid noticing
the resemblance of this opinion of Perrault with that
of the primordial egg of the Bramins, of which the

Ordinances of Menu give us the following account,
as translated from the original Sanscrit by Sir Wm.

Jones. ‘⁴ He whom the mind alone can perceive‚
having wiued to produce various beings from his

910

own divine substance, first, with a thought, created
the waters, and placed in them a productive seed.
That seed became an cgg bright as gold, blazing
like the luminary, with a thousand beams3 and in
that egg he was born himself, in the form of Brahma,
thergreat forefather of all spirits. In that egg the
great power sat inactive a whole year of the creator,
at the close of which, by his thought alone, he
caused the cgg to divide itself3 and from its two
divisions he framed the heaven above, and the earth
beneath3 and in the midst he placed the subtile
ether, the eight regions, and the permanent recep*
taele of waters.’' Vol. iii. p. 66.

Much of this doctrine was afterwards introduced
into Greece, probably by Orpheus, through the medium
of Egypt, and was, for many centuries, regarded as sa-
cred and indisputable.

Among modern theories of generation, that of
Dr. Darwin has lately excited the greatest degree
of attention. It supposes the human frame to ema-
nate froma fibril of the male, uniting with seminal mole-
cules of the female. But his view of the origin
of plants appears to be different, and bears a closer
approximation to the theory of Ruysch and De
Graaf. If my memory fail me not, he has asserted,
both in his Botanic Garden, and his Phytologia,
that the seeds of all plants contain in their substance,
not only the germ or rudiment of the future plant,
but the whole of its leaves and branches; as does,
likewise, the bud of the pedicularis and hepatica3
and the hybernacle of the hyacinth, and most other
plants propagated from bulbous rootS.

The very accurate Spalanzani has indeed disco-
vered in these bulbous roots different races of the
same plant to the fourth generation; and has
traced the same appearance in a variety of animals as
well as vegetables. In the female volvox, an insect
found chiefly in infusions of hemp-seed and trcmelkr,
and the putrid water of dunghills, some naturalists
of his acquaintance. he tells us, observed the future
fetus in the womb extending to the fifth generationi
Hc has himself traced it to the third, even through
