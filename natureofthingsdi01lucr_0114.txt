e THE LIFE 01³ LUCRETIUS.

Thus perished‚ untimely, Titus Lueretius Carus, the immortal au·-
thor of Tin: Nmmua or Tnmos, and whom Scaliger, with a feli-
citous brevity of character, has denominated “ a divine man, and an
incomparable poet *Γ But virtue and talents have no arbitrary con-
trol over the mutable enjoyments of the present world: and not Lu-
cretius alone, but almost every ono of those illustrious Romans, whom
I have enumerated as the friends of his youth, may· be adduced as
forcible examples of the truth of this position. There is, indeed, a
similarity of fate and missortune attendant upon *the latter part of
their lives, so truly astonishing, if not altogether unparalkssed, that
I cannot consent to close this biography without taking a brief glauce
at it.

Caius Memmius, who, as Ι have already observed‚ was banished‚
by his countrymen, into Greece, died during his exile. He retii-ed,

himself must have written erroneously, when he alluded to a verse in the twenty-first book of Lucretius,
or that some transcribet of Varro has equally erred in writing Lucretius for Lucilius, or some other poet
whose labours have not descended to the present day. But the author of the Nature of Things appears
to have settled the controversy in the completest manner himself, by pointing out to us, in two express
passages, the first and last books of which the poem was ever designed to consist.
Thus, that the sixth book was to conclude the work, we may collect from the following verses towards
the commencement of this very book itself:
Tu mihi suprema· praescripta ad mnditia calcis
Currenti spatium praemonstra, callida Musa,
Calliope! requies hominum, divomque voluptas:
Te duce ut insigni capiam cum laude coronam. Lib. VI. v. 91,
Muse most expert, belov’d of gods and men,
Calliope! O aid me as Ι tread
Now the last limit: eff the path prescrib’d,
“rhat the bright crown wizh plaudits I may claim. ν. 94.

And that, the doctrine of a vacuum constituted the subject of the first book, we leam from the fol»⁴

¹ vm ἐ
lm g Nunc omnes repetam quam raro corpore sint res,

mememoraoe, quod iu primo quoque carmine clam„ Lih. VI. v. 936„

This thus premis’d, recal we next to mind
How rare the frame of all things, as ere while
Conspicuous prov'd we in our earliest strain.
