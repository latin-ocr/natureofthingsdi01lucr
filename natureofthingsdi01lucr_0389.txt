THE NATURE OF THINGS.

241

Some secret source of pleasure or of pain.

So deem not thou the saw’s discordant scream,

Horrid, and harsh, fiows from the same smooth seeds

415

That wake the strain mellifluous, when the fair,

With flying fingers, sweeps th’ accordant lyrc.

Nor deem those atoms like, from putrid scenos

That spring malignam, and th’ essential sweets

Breath’d from Gnaeum saffron, or the blaze

420

Of fragrant altars fed from orient groves.

Nor canst thou form from the same source those hues,

On which the vision feeds with fond delight‚

And those abhorr'd, and hideous, or the germs

Pungent and keen, that rousc the sight to tears.

The minstrel, thus, inflam’d with sacred ἣτε,

ἊἿιοεεβγίηξβημη stn'ke the sounding lyre‚

Wake the shrill strings, and, o’er thy mvish'd ear,

Breathe the sweet balm of movements sost and
clear-—

So on the lyre depends, that nought of stmin

void of its influence, can his hands attain.

Nor ought 1 to forget the elegant imitation of thie

passage of our poet, in the Oberon of Wielaud,
Canto xi.

How does her rosyfinger’s :rtbtlefligrht
In sweet confiusion sweep each seul-felt string!
Soa-asar.

country of Asia Minor, was celebrated by almost
all the Roman poets for its unrivalled saffron. Pro-
pertine has adver-ted to it in more than one place on

this account; and Virgil has thus announced the
'name fact in his Culexa:

Vm. Ι.

 

425

Heio et acanthus

Et rosa purpureo crescit pudibunda colore ε

Et violae genus omne heic est, et Spartica myrtus.
Atque hyacinthus ς et heic Cilici crocus editus antro.

 

Ver. 400.

Here springs the violet, th' acanthus blows,

Here Sparta's myrtle‚ and the blushing rose ;
Bluc hyacintha, and saffron boasting blooms

Bright as the sffon in Cilicia's glooms.

Among theluxuries in which the Romans indulged
in their more voluptuous periods, one was, the fashion
of strewing this Cilician saffron, in conjunction with
several other odorifer-ons flowers, over the stages of
their public theatres, prior to the commencement of
the drama. It is to this custom Lucretius appears to
allude, in the present passage; and Horace has an
allusion ofthe same kind, in his Epistle to Augustus :

Recte necne, crocum floresque perambulet Attae
Fabula, si dubitem ς clament periisse pudorem, διε.
Ver. 79.
