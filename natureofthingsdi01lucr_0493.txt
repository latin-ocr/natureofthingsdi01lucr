ΤΗΕ NATURE OF THINGS. 345

Who the vast whole could guide‚ midst all your ranks ,Ρ

Who grasp the reins that curb th' ENTIRE or THINGS ἓ

17 Are to thine eyes the gates of death reveal'd ?

The gates where death’s dread shadows lurk
conceal'd ?

31 Canst thou the teerning Pleiades restrain ?
Or break Orion's icy bands in twain ?

332 Whirl round th' undevious Zodiac ἓ or the dance
Of bright Arcturus and his sons advance?

33 Knows’t thou the laws that regulate the spheres ἓ
Is it from thee that earth their power reveres ἓ

34 Lift to the clouds thy voice, and will they swarm
Round thee in robes of show'rs and torrent storm?

35 Will, at thy call. the lightnings rush,and say,
“ Lo ! here we are,-command, and we obey ?’'

CHAP. xl.

9 Hast thou an arm like God? like him to roll

The volleying thunders round th' affrightcd pole ?

10 Come! cloath thyself with majesty and might,
Let glory gird thee with unsuff’ring light ;

1 1 Shoot from thy nostrils flames of arrowy tire,
Search out the proud, and let them feel thine ire :

12 Seareh out the proud‚ and crnsh them to the dust ς
With their own arms exterminate th’ unjust.

For the few variations from our standard text,
which are offered in this version, it is necessary to snb—
join a remark or two.

Ch. xxxviii. 4.—“ Thy wisdom doubtless knows.''
The common reading runs thus, conditionally .· “ Dc-
clare {sthou hast understanding ;'’ but the original ra-
ther implies an irony than a condition, and may be ren-
dered with infinitely more force, “ Declure, for
doubtless thou hast understanding.'’ The particle D&
in the expression ,72⁹3 ,ny-v ΞΝ is as clearly affir-
mative in the present instance, as in Hos. xii. Ι 1. or
Ps. cxxxix. 19.whcre it is uniformly so rendered.

The astronomic terms employed in v. 31, and 32,
have puzzled the critics in every age, Hebrew, Greek,
and Latin, as well as those of more modern times.
The synonymous renderings of the Septuagint seem
nevertheless to be correct so far aa they extend, not-
withstanding the original is differently interpreted in
several versions of greater antiquity. Admitting the

Septuagint version, the Pleiades are elegantly opposed

to Orion, as the vernal renovation of nature is oppmed
to its brumal destruction—the rnild and open benig-
nity of spring, to the severe and icy inactivity of
winter. The Pleiades are a constellation of seven
stars in the sign Taurus, and make their appearance
in the spring—time, whence they arc denominated by
Virgil, Vergiliae. The Hebrew term Chimah (ΠῺᾏῚ,
with which the constellation Pleiades is supposed to
correspond, is peculiarly beautiful in its origin, and
implies whatever is desii-able, delightfnl or lovely, for
such is the meaning of the radical verb 3722. It is
probably from ‘7³02 (Chesil or Orion) that the He-
brews derived the name of their first winter month
which they denominate Chisleu‚ and which cor-
responds with a part of our own November: the
constellation itself appears towards the latter part of
November, through December, and a part ofJanuaryv
and hence offers a correct and elegant synecdoche for
the winter at large. The Arabians still employ the

term ὼί(οὶιεεί1) to express coldness and inac-

tivity: orizon, toaesponfiigns. This, however, is not the
word introduced into the Arabic versionof the passage

before us, but [ϋμΝΗ

The translators of the Septuagint did not know
the real meaning of the Hebrew term ΠῚἾΜ)
(Mazaroth), and have therefore retained it without

offering any synonym, in which conduct they have

St. Chry·

stars which are commonly called the Zo-Jjac: though
others assert that Mazaroth is a Hel-new term for
Sirius or the dog-star.U OftheSt interpretations the
latter, I believe, has been generally preferred. I,
however, have venturtd to adopt the former, not
merely on the authority of St. Chrysostom, but be-
cause I have no doubt that the term 17³7OE (Maza-
loth), in 2 lffings, xxiii. 5. was originally the same
word, and has been corrupted by the mistake of a ἶ)
for a Ἶ ; and because, in this latter place, it means
