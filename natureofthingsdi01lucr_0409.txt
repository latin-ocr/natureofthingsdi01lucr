3001< ΙΙ.

Masts, yardS‚ and streamerS, cordage, sails‚ and helms,

THE NATURE OF THINGS.

261

560

And planks disparted‚ teaching as they float

What dangers lurk unseen 3 what snares to lure

Unthinking mortals 3—-and forewarning loud

To fly the smooth temptation‚ nor e'en once

Trust the false waves‚ though deck’d in loudest laugh ε

565

So, should'st thou make the primal seeds of aught

Once finite, instant the tumultuous war

Of adverse atoms, through the boun-dless void

Drives them far-distant—never more to meet,

Or met, cohere, or e'en, cohering, groW:

The world of waters bellows to the blast :

The vessel reels at random to and fro,

The boatswain calls in vain, while shrieks of woe

Ring thro’ the staggering ship‚ all hope of safety
past !

The wind's unbridl’d rage, the heaven that. bums,
Enwrapt in flames like helvs sulphureons tides,
The crackling of the vessel's rifted sides,

That now, as rise and fall the waves by turns,
Sinks, buried in the dark, unfathom⁷d deep !

Now rocks upon the billow's ridgy steep,

While all beneath in foamy vapour dies ;

These soumis, of power to force the dead to rise,
Awake the conscious pair from love’s enchantcd

sleep.

1 cannot close this note, long as it is, without re-
commending td the reader's perusal, at his own lei-
sure, that full, and, in my* opinion, unrivalled de-
scription of a sea—storm‚ introduced by Camoens into
the sixth book of his Lusiad. The passage is far
too voluminous for insertion, but it begins thus ε

Mas neste passo assi promptos estando,
Eis o mestre, que olhando os ares anda

570

Ο apito toea, accordz'io desportando
Os mannheiros d’ hfia e d' outm banda, &cu

When shrilly whistling thro' the ilccks resounds
The master’s call, and loud his voice rebounds;
Instant from converse, and from slumber start
Both hands, and instant to their toils theydart,&c.

Ῑ quote from Mr. M2ckle's version, who has tran-
slated the whole with admirable spirit. On the truly
poetical machinery by which this tempest was al-
layed, and the affrighted navigators conducted to
the desired haven, I have had occasion to refer al-
ready, in the note on Book Ι. v. 1.

Ver. 565. T rust the false waves, though zlecb'd in

loudest laag& :] See note on Book I. 8. and

5⁴05 of Book II. and hence, with much probability,
the classical and accomplished Gray :

Fair laughs the morn, and soft the zephyr blein-s,

While proudly riding o'er the azure realm

In gallant trim the gilded vessel goes 3

Youth on the prow, and Pleasure at the helm ε

Regardless ofthe swecping W hirlwlnd’s sway,

That, hush’d in grim '‘epm-e, expects his evening pay.
