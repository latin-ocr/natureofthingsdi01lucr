Atque haurire3 juvatque novos decerpere flores,

Insignemque meo capiti petere inde coronam,

Unde prius nulli velarint tempora Musae.

Primum, quod magnis doceo de rebus, et artis

Deinde, quod obscura de re tam lucida pango

Ver. 991. Thosestow'rs to pluck‚ and weave a ro-

seat wreath,] The translation of Creech has

metamorphosed this flowery wreath of our poet in-
to a chaplet of laurel:

none of anthe mighty tuneful Nine
Shall grace a head with laurels like to mine.

 

His commentator on this passage, however, can-
didly observes, that in the original no mention is
made of laurel; and that garlands and wreaths of
ivy seem to have been the first ornament of poem,
and other learned rnen, and laurel the decoration of
conquerors. Thus Horace:

“ Me doctarum Hedera· praemia frontium
Dis miscent superis.''

Yet it is very uncertain whether the me in this ad-
dress of Horace ought not to be te, and refer to
Maecenas, the poet'j patron, agreeably to the in-
genious conjecture of Rutgers‚ who has since been
followed by a variety of able critics of all countries.
Be this, however, as it may, it is obvious, that Lu-
cretius has no allusion either to the ivy or the laurel
in the passage before t1s, sor he expressly employs
the term flores, or floruerit, which will not conveni-
ently apply to either of them z

 

juvatque novos decerpere flores,

Insignemque meo capiti petere mm: coronam.

Sweet the new flowers that bloom, but sweeter still
'lfhose flowers to pluck, andweave a roseat wreath.

The custom of adorning with crowns, or chaplets
of flowers interwoven with foliage, those who had
peculiarly distinguished themselves in the arts of war,
of music, or of poetry‚ is ‘almost as ancient as
those arts themselves. It was occasionally forbid—
den, under severe penahies, by the more zealous of
the Roman emperors, after their eor-version to Chris-
tianity, as being supposed to partake of the super-
stitious of paganism. Parmae, however, to a cer-
tainty. even so late as the middle of the fourteenth cen-
tury, was fortunate enough to enjoy this honour of
poetic coronation, confert-ed with every possible de-
gree of publicity and spkndour, and attended upon
by the senators, and many of the council, at the
Roman capitol: a detailed account of which traus-
action is inserted in Tiraboschi’s Storia della Lite-
ratura Italiana. There is great reason also to be-
lieve, notwithstanding the doubts which have been
entertained on the subject-by some persons, that
Aarosro, a full centuryafterwards, was admitted to a
similar distinction, and was even crowned by the hands
of the emperor Charles V. Such, at least, is the decla-
ration of the monument now in existence in the
church of the Benedictines at Florence, erected to
his memory in the year 1612, by Ludovico Arinem,
a collateral branch of his family.

Of all the Grecian poets‚ Anacreon is the most
frequent in his reference to this custom of decorating
the temples with flowery chaplets ; and his ssower is,
