APPENDIX.

HAVING thus amassed together the scattered fragments that relate to
the life of Lucretius, added some few memoirs of other illustrious Epi-
cureans who were his coevals and friends, and attentively examined the
doctrines they profcssed, I proceed to offer a brief sketch of the alter-
nate support and opposition experienced by this celebrated school in

subsequent aeras.

J t is once more necessary to observe, that every school of philosophy
among the Greeks, whether of Ionic or Italic origin, as well as every
Sect whom they proudly denominated barbarian, whether Chaldean,
Egyptian, Persian, or Celtic, pre-supposed the eternal existence of
matter: upon the form or mode, however, of its original existence, and
the process by which it acquired its present appearance and organiza-
tion, they differed very materially; some maintaining, that every thing
has existed from everlasting, as it appears at present ; and others, that
the visible world has had a beginning.

Among the Greeks, Ocellus Lucanus and Aristotle were the chief
who contended for the first opinion: the former asserting, that the uni—
verse is utterly incapable of generation or corruption, of beginning or
end, and that it is of itself perfect, permanent, and eternal; and the
latter, asserting still more expressly‚ not only that the universe, as to
its elementary matter and general configuration, is eternal and unde-
rived‚ but that mankind, and every other species of animals, have sub-
sisted by an uninterrupted chain of propagations from all eternity,
