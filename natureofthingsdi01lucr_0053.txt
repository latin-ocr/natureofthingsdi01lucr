THE LIFE OF LUCRETtUS. xxxix

the former, a short timo anterior to his decease, adopted a young and
particular friend of the latter as his heir. That this was the real ground
of dispute, is rendered still more probable by the linet, that on the recal
of Cicero to Home, which was chiefly brought about by thc interposi-
tion of Coesar himself, the two disputants were not only reconeiled,

but, from that time, united in the support of each other's interest.

The difficulties with which Lucretius had to struggle, in the compo-
sition ofliis poem, were great and 1n11ne1·ous; and we cannot wonder
at his frequently feeling their emharassing cfl‘octs, and occasionally
alluding to them in his progress. The subject he had selected, though
the noblest, was the most profonnd, as well as the most eomprehen-
sive, that can ever engage the attention of the human 1nind; nor is
there any title by which it could be designated so pertinently as that
selected by himself, THE NATURE or T111NGs. It embraces the
whole scope of natural, metaphysical, and moral philosophy; and to
execute it with any great degree of success, required a knowledge

almost, if not altogether, universal.

The first difficulty Lucretius had to surmouut, was produced by the
Latin language itself. To philosophy it was a total stranger; aud
though rich and nervous with respect to subjects introduced into the
senate, or at the forum, it displayed a dreadful poverty and imbecili-
ty in matters of metaphysieal science. The only poets, indeed, ofany
kind, who had ever preceded him in hexameter verse, were Livius An-
dronicus, Ennius, and Naevius; and of these three, the second alone
was worthy of any degree of notice; who, on this account, though he
wrote after Andronicus ἐξ, has been justly regarded as the father of Ro-

* Horace, in speaking of Livius Andronicus, does not wish for the destruction of his poems, but is
‘surprised that they should ever have been esteemed : ⁷
