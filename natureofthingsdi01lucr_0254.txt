DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. 1.

Ignem, atque ex igni summam consistere solo,

Magno opere a vera labsi ratione videntur.

Heraclitus init quorum dux praelia primus,

Clarus ob obscuram linguam magis inter inaneis,

640

Quamde graveis inter, GraiOS, quei vera requirunt.

Omnia enim stolidei magis admirantur, amantque,

Inversis quae sub verbis latitantia cernunt ;

engross too much time, as well as paper. I refer the
reader, therefore, to the works of VVoodward,
VVhitehurst, Howard, and Kirwan.

Dr. Hutton published a theory of the earth about
sonrteen years ago, in the Edinbm·gh Philosophical
Transactions, in which, after contending for thc ex-
istence of an immense subterraneous fire in its center,
he endeavours to prove that every substance in con-
tact‚ or nearly in contact with this fiery mass, is
fused by its operation; and when fused, raised by
the violence of its heat above the level of the sea:
that all the continents we have discovered, and the
most solid strata of which they consist, have been
thus formed: that new continents are perpetually
rcaring in the same manner, from the wasting parti-
cles of those at present existing ; and that these new
ones will ascend, and appear hereafter, when those
now existing shall have been entirely frittered away.
This theory, which is in no small degree confused
and inconsistent, has been attached with ability and
spirit by Μ. Dc Luc and Mr. Kirwan, who attribute
all the phaenomena of nature to aqueous solution, a
theory more minutely adverted to in various notes in
book v., where our poet gives his own system of cos-
mology.

M. de Mairan has attempted to prove that the
earth is infinitely more indebted‚ for the heat it re-
ceives, to its own central fires than to the rays of the
sun. He allows that this latter, by adding some
’ portion of heat to the surface of the earth, is the
immediate cause of the vicissitude of the season53

but assem, that were it not for the continual ascent
of an immense quantity of subtermnean beat, though
the sun were perpetually to illuminate two thirds of
the globe at once with a heat equal to that at the
equator, the entire orb would soon condense into one
general mass of solid ice. His reasonings on this .
subject are too long and intricate for insertion. There
is, however, much ingenuity in them, and they are
to be found in the Hist. de l’Acad. des Sciences,
l’ann· 17'65. See also note on b. v. ver. 425. It is
probably from this theory that Klopstock has drawn
his beautiful machinery of an vinterior world in the
earth’s center, in which reside the guardian spirits of
the globe, and the souls of departed saints3 it is a
paradise where celestial breezes blow‚ eternal splendour
smiles, and the Almighty communicates, in an es·
pecial manner, the wonders of his provideuce and
grace to thc beatified inhabitants. Here a sun, that
never sets or rises, shines with pure and uninterrupted
radiance, from the beams of which the surface of the
earth itself is perpetually nourished and rendered fertile.
Von ihr fliesst leben und w'zirme

In die adern der erd’ empor. Die oberste sonne
Bildet mit dieser vertiauten gehiilsmn den blumigen

 

friihling, ,
Und den feurigen summer, von sinkenden halme
belastet‚
Und den herbst anf traubengebirgen. In ihren
bezirken

Ist sie niemals anf, und niemals untergegangen.
