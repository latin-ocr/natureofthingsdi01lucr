Hues born of sun—beams‚ changing but their shades

Thus the gay piclgeon, as his plumes he ψῆνες,

Mr. Hoole's version of this passage is elegant, but
so general as to lose all sight of the original ; and the
reader must, therefore, accept of the following:

Such, oft, the lovcly colours that bcdeck,

Amidst his am'rous sport, the pidgeon’s neck.

No constant hue= it keeps, but ever plays,

With tints diverse, beneath the solar rays.

Now all the ruby in rich necklaee glows ;

Now its own light the verdant cmerald throws ;

Now close they blend, and vague, and various
still,

The gazer's eye with countless beauties fill.

The beautiful mul‘tiplicity of colours which are
thus produced, and perpetually variegated, results
from the resemblance of the filaments of the plumes
to prisms3 and the nearer this resemblance can be
traced‚ both with respect to shape and transparency‚
the more numerous will be the colours refracted‚ and
the greater their vivacity and richness.

With respect to the colours of precious stones, it
is a fact, now fairly decided in chemistry, that all of
them depcnd upon a solution of some peculiar metal
iu some peculial· aeid : and that, of the various me-
tals, iron is more frequently employed by nature than
any other. But the immediate substance, or prepara-
tion of iron, by which the ruby and the emerald ac-
quire their appropriate hue-², is altogether a modern
discovery, and was, I believe, first detected by M.
Vauquelin, iu his analysis of the aigne marine, or
beryl. The investigation unfolded to him a new
earth, which is the basis, both of this lervel, and, as
he afterwards ascertained‚ of the emcrald and ruby.
This new earth bears a considerable resemblance to
alumine, but, nevertheless‚ differs from it in several
radical properties : from the sweetness ofits taste the
French chemist assigned it the name of Glycine.

When to this terrene basis is added some portion of
that pe eici ·liar prep·a1ation of iron which is denomina-

ted the oxyd of chronic, and which bears a great re-

se mli' ance to lime, the bcryl, the emerald, aud the
ruby become the produce of the combination: and
the colour or specilic gem depends upon the degree
of oxydation this chamaeleon-like metal has sustained ;
when highly oxydated, producing a red tincture, and
a green when the oxydation is but small. For a far-
ther account of this process, see the Frcnch Annales
de Chymie, vol. xxm

The admirable picture before us, of the changeful
colours in the plumes of the peacock, cannot but re-

mind us of Thomson’s equally excellent description
of the opal :

311 combin'd
Thick through the whitening opal play thy beams ;

 

Or, flying several from the surface, form
A trembling variance of revolving hues
As the site varies in the gazer's hand.

Every one is acquainted with thc very correct and
exquisite delineation of the pheasant in Pope’s Wind-
sor Forest ; which was translated into French verse
no later ago than179S, with considerable accuracy and
spirit, by M. Viel de Boisjolin. If we compare it
with our own poet's description of the pidgeon, there
is a resemblance which mayjustly induce us to sus-
pect that Popc himself had Lucretius in liis recol·
lection at the time of composiug it :

See ! from the brake the whirring pheasant springs,
And mounts, exusting, on triumphant wings :
Short is his Joy; he feels the fiery wound,
Flutters in blood, and, panfing, bcats the ground.
Ah. ¹ what avails hisn glossy varying dyes,

His purple erest, and scarle t· circletl eyes.
