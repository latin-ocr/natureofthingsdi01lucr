THE NATURE OF THINGS.

Rush they, in equal hour through ampler space
Urg'd‚ than the beams that gild the glowing vault.

No pause for council need they, no delay‚

Nor deep research to sever right from wrong,

Or prove What path their duty bids pursue.

Yet some there are, untaught‚ who dare contend.

Primordial matter ne’er without the gods

Thus, in nice symmetry, to please mankind,

Could form th’ alternate seasons‚ rear the fruits

That gladden life, or urge those gentler joys,

calculation ; and that when the earth is nearly in the
opposite point of her orbit‚ the eclipse uniformly
appears to take place about eight minutes later than
the tables predict them. Hence, it was fairly re-
solved, that the rays of light consist of small cor-
puscles, not acting instantaneously‚ but requiring
about 16} minutes to fly through a space equal to the
diameter of the earth's orbit ; and that this, amount-
ing to at least 190 millions of miles, the particles of
light move at the inconceivable rate of eleven mil-
lions of miles in a minute, which is nearly a million
times swifter than a cannon ball.

Allowing the materiality of light, it is not foreign
to our purpose, in this place, to notice the iucom-
prehensibly small corpuscles of which it is composed.
1 shall therefore just state, that from many accurate
experiments‚ Dr. Nieuwentyt has computed‚ that an
ineh of candle, when converted into light, becomes
divided into 269,617,040 parts, with 40 κει-οε, or
ciphers annexed: at which rate, there must issue
out of it, when buming, 418‚663, with 39 ciphers
more, particles in a second of a minute, which is
vastly more than a thousand times a thousand million
times the number of sands the whole earth can con-
tain, reckoning ten inches to one foot, and that 100

sands are equal to one inch. 1 have added this ob-
servation on the minuteness of the particles of light,
to give some faint idea of the inconceivably smaller
dimensions of thc primal particles of matter3 since.
according to the Epicurean doctrine, every corpuscle
of light is a body compounded of a large number of
such particles.

Ver. 172. Yet some there are, untanght, who dare

contend] The poet here alludes, both 'to the

Stoic system, and the popular theology z the former

of which maintained, that the world itself was a di-

vine and intelligent being ; and the latter, that it was

the productiori of the gross aud feeble gods, that were
worshipped by the people at large.

Ver. 177. Gay Pmmsuaz, guide, andgoddess ofrhe
world‚] Much nujust obloquyhas been thrown

on our author, and the entire sect of Epicurus,
from an ill-founded idea, that the whole of their phi-
losophy consisted in carnal pleasures and indulgences.
This idea I have already controvertcd, in the note on
ver. 16, of this book. The assei-tion, contained in
the verse before us, that “ ansnmz is the guide,
and goddess of the world? was never meant by oux
