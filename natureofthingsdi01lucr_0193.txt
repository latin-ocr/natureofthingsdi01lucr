as well as of the ancient Jews, we should make an
approach much near-er still to the cosmology of Epi-
curus: for several of them not only believed in the
gradual evolution of the world, but in the eternity of
matter itself; conceiving that matter was necessarily
co-eternal with God, as the solar rays are co‘e'val with
the sun. Philo appears to have been altogether a
Platonist upon this subject. See his Cosniog. vol. 1.
p. 5. nov. ed.; aud Justin Martyr‚ Apol. 59, af-
firms, that the doctrine* of Plato, with respect to the
creation of the world, is the very doctrine of Mos-effi

and from Moses was horrowed, Ῑνα δε και παρα των

seif, is indeed expressly made mention of by the writer ‘c
of the book of VVisdom, chap. xi. 17 ;. and he has also ιι
been supposed, in consequence, to have been attached ιι
to the whole of this opinion. In reality, it is not easy ιι

to extricate him from the charge ; and origen, who

enters expressly into an 'examination of the passage, ις
feels himself compelled to remark, that this book is ιι

not received by all as canonical Scripture. Fw,
however, besides Maimonides, have chosen to con-
tend, that the Hebrew ΝἾ] created, in Gen. i. 1.
necessarily implies an absolute creation out ⁰f nothing.
It has been of late very generally believed on the
continent, and probably with a view of reconciling
the apparent incongruity of the origin of matter out
of nothing, upon-Christian principles, that. the world
is an emanation of the substance of the Supreme
Being. Mr. Kant. is supposed to favour this belief.
It has been professedly brou¹ght forwards and sup-
ported by M. Isnard, in his work “ Sur l’Immor-
talite'e de l'Ame‚'‘’ printed at Paris in 18023 and is

approved of by M. Anquetil du Peri-on, the learned
translator of the Oupnek’ -hat, or abridgement of the
Veids. The difficulty, however, does not appear to
be in any great degree diminishe d by such a conjec-
tu e; for, if matter be an emanation from the sub-
stance of the Deity, thenis the Deity himself ma·
terial, and matter becom s not only eternal, but the
Eternal God, the very essence of the Divine Being:
a doctrine far exceeding the impiety of the atomio
hypothesis, and infinitely more absurd. It is, more-
over, a me re revivification of the wildest dogmas of
Plato and Pythagoras, obviously (1( rived from India,

‚ and still existing in the Braminic Veids. It ιε thus

stated' ln M. Perron' s version of the Oupnek’-hat‚ to

which Ι have just referred ε “ The whole universe is

‘⁵ the Creator, proceeds from the Creator, subsists
in him, and returns to him. The ignorant assert
“ that the universe, in the beginning, did not exist.
in its author, aud that it was created outof no-
thing. ——O ye, whose hearts are pure, how could

something warise out of nothing ι’ This first Being,
alone, and without likeness, was the ALL in the

‘⁴ bro ginning: he could multiply himself under dif-
ferent forms: he created fire from his essemc,
which is light, &c.'’

'l'he whole of this doctrine of the Epicurean school
is thus fully detailed, by the cardinal Polignac:

Ex nihilo nil fit : lex inviolabilis esto ε

Nil ruit in nihilum, clamat tota schola Epicuri.

Ergo si une sunt, aeterna fuer-c3 nec unquam

Cessatura manent. Intermoriuntur ubique

Corpora, materies autem quae corpora fundat

Semper erit, fuit, est : finemque ignorat et ortum.
Ami-Lem. ix. 471.

Nought springs from nought : be this th' etei-nal law:
To nought nouglit tends, shouts all th’ atomics
school. ,
