BooK ΙΙ. THE NATURE OF THINGS.

A force far different this than e’er prevails
When aught without coerces. Passive, then, 280
Bends all the frame th’ extrinsic power beneath,
, Borne down reluctant3 till th' awakening will
Unchains each member, and resumes her right.
For oft, though foreign force, with tyrant sway,
Rule US, resistless‚ headlong hurrying down— 28 5
Say—lurks no adverse something in the breast
Proud to withstand? full oft, at whose control,
Swift flows the nervous tide from limb to limb,
Bursting each hond—and, oft, as swift‚ retires?
Hence firm maintain we prima] seeds some cause 290
Must feel of rising motion unbestow’d
By weight, or blow re—active, whence alone
Upsprings this secret power by man possest:
Nought forming nought, as reason proves precise.
For weight forbids the credence that alone 295
Thin'gs by re-action move3 yet, lest the mind
Bend to a stern necessity within,
And, like a slave, determine but by force,—
’ Though urg'd by weight‚ in time, in place unfixt,
Each primal atom trivial still declines goo

Nor interstitial more, nor more compact,

&was e'er this frame of matter3 nor augment .

Primaeval seeds, nor e'er admit decay.
