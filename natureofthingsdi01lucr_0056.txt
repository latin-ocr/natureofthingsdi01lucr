xlii THE LIFE OF LUCRETIUS.

the fashion of the day, without destroying its genuine order of archi-
tecture ; to introduce the hoary stranger into company with his juniors,
and to obtain for him that attention to which, by his yeam, he is en-
titled. No poet has ever expressed himself upon this subject with

more felicity thau Horace, in a passage which I shall take the liberty
of translating z

Stamp'd is thy taste if, dextrous, thou discern

For hackney'd terms some new unhackney’d turn.
If themes abstruse, to modern numbers strange,
Perplex thy pow’rs, assume an ampler range :

Call back to life sounds obsolete and old,

The cause demands it, and thou may'st be bold ;
Or the fresh stores the Grecian fount supplies,
Bent but a little, frequent may suffice.

These fearless take: for why should Rome concede
A claim to bards, whom now we seldom read,
Cecilius, Plautus, that the clasfic strain

Of Virgil asks, or Varius, but in vain?

Why should myself not glean, if glean I may,

In the same fields, unlimited as they,

Where Ennius, Cato, cull’d unfading flow’rs,

T rimm'd the new growth, and made th’ exotics ours?
Yet less approv’d it must be to purloin

From foreign mints, than use a native coin.

As falls the foliage with the falling year,

Yet with the spring new foliage pants t' appear,

So perish phrases—so a junior race

Spring into birth and fill their parents' place.

Man dies himself, and all that man can boast z
E’en the vast bason o'er the Roman coast,

Imperial plan! that bids our navy ride

In conscious triumph, and defy the tide ς

E’en the broad plain that, late, a drear morass,
Now springs productive o’er the wat’ry mass,

Bears the stern plough-share, and to cities round
Spreads its gay scene, with russet harvests crown'd 3
