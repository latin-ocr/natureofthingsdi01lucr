ΤΗΕ NATURE OF THINGS.

Pours forth her sweetest How’rets; Ocean laughs‚

And the blue Heavens in cloudless splendour deck'd.

For, when the Spring first opes her frolick eye,

10

And genial Zephyrs longlock’d up respire‚

Ibid. -Ocecm laughs,] In the original, “ rident
aequora ponti.'’ Creech, as I have already no-
ticed‚ has translated the verb rident by the English
term smile; as have also Evclyn, Dryden, and even
Guernier in his prose version. But why this more

feeble term should be adopted, instead of the true and ‘5
forcible synonym, laugh, I am at a loss to determine. ‘⁶
Even Marchetti, of whom I have not spoken in the ‘4

preface with more approbation than he merits, has
failed in this bold and beautiful figure. These are
his words x

Tu rassereni i giomi foschi' e rendi

Col dolce sguardo il mar chiara e tranquillo.

Metastasio‚ however, has compensated for the cold-
ness and injustice of his countryman. He has copied
this passage of Lucretius into the version I have just
spoken of, and has rendered it complete and spirited:

A tefioriscono
Gli erbosi prati
E iflutti ridono
Nel mar placati.

To thee the fields so gay
In sweetest flow’rets blow;
Laugh the hush'd winds, and play
The placid deep below.

Chaucer has happily imitated the same nervous
metaphor, but has applied it to the sun. Cant.
Knight's Tale 1495.

And fierie Phebus rysith up so bright,
That all the orient laughith at the sight.

It is the more extraordinary that Dryden, in his
translation of Lucretius, should, like Creech, have
employed the tamer epitbet of smile, because, in his
borrowing the above passage from Chaucer, he has
very justly retained the more manly expression of
both Chaucer and Lucretius. Palamon and Arcite,
b. ii.

The morning lark, the messenger of day,
Saluted, with her song, the morning gray:

And soon the sun arose with beams so bright,

That all th¹ horizon laugh’d to see the joyous sight.

Thus, too, in the Berrathron of Ossian : “ When
thou comest forth in thy mildness, the gale of
the morning is near thy course: the sun laughs

ιἰἓιὶ1 his blue fields3 the grey stream winds in its
“ v e.''

In the same manner, Gessner, in his “ Death of
Abel‚'’ b. 1. Sey uns gegriist du liebliche sonne⁸
du giessest farb' und anmuth durch die natur, und
jede schonheit lachet verjiingt uns wieder entgegen.
“ Welcome once more, thou lovely sun ! thou givest
“ colours and graces to all nature ; and every beauty
“ laughs with renewed youth around us.”

But the boldest copy I have met with ofthis image
of Lucretius, is by the Spanish poet Lope de Vega,
in his Hermosura de Angelica, cant. xiii.

Mueve las bojas de la selva el viento
Y la risa del agua fugitiva,
Conciertase con ellae de tal modo
Qe parece que esta cantando todo.

Now shakes the grove's green foliage to the breeze,
Wth laughter shakes the stream’s perpetual flight x
’Tis harmony throughout ; and earth and seas

In songs qfloudfhstt'vi& unite. ,

These verses have all the force of Oriental poetry,
and are, perhaps, only exceeded by the following
energetic and par-allel passage of the Psalmist ε

Let the sea shout, and all its fulness ;

The world, and all its inhabitants;

Let the floods clap their hands,

And the mountains unite in exstacy,

At the presence of Jehovah who approacheth.

C Ps. xcvii. 7, 8,
