Sum-2, mari magno turbantibus aequora ventis,

Ver. 1. How sweet to stt-md, when tempests tear the
nzairz‚] Nothing truly valuable is to be ac-
quired without severe application and labour. The
put-suit of riches‚ honours, or fame, demands inces-
sant exertion, and is accompanied with perpetual
anxiety3 an anxiety that frequently poisons every
enjoyment‚ and too dearly purchases the object of
our tofis, even if it be purchased at last. But the
pursuit of knowledge differs essentially from every
other exertion: it, too, has- its difficulties and its
labours, its briars to clear away, and its precipices
to surmount: but its path is free from anxiety and
disappointment; and the man who gains possession

of its summit, feels himself elevated above the world?

and may well look with pity on the crowds that· are
struggling below him. Impressed with this senti-
ment, our poet opens the book before us: and the
beauty and elegance of his imagery have produced a
host of imitators; not one of whom, however, to
the best of my knowledge, has, by any meana, equalled

himself. For the idea contained in the first two
verses Lucretius, however, seems, in some measure,
to have been indebted to Isidorus. ‘⁴ Nothing is
more pleasant,’' says this writer, ‘⁶ than to sit at ease
in the harbour, and behold the shipwreck of others :''
εν λιμενι καθῆσθαι, και τα των αλλων &nomn vacuasque.—
Pelus. Lib. ii. :Ep-240· The following description
of Akenside will here perhaps arise in the mind of
every reader ·, and it is not unlikely that Lucretius
was the original from which he drew: we have al-
ready traced him occasionally turning his eye to the
poem before us z

ask the crowd

Which flies impatient from the village walk,

‘To climb the neigbb’ring diff, when far below

The cruel winds have hurl’d upon the coast

Some hapless bark: while sacred Pity melts

The general> eye, or Terror's icy hand

Smites their distorted limbs, and horrent hair ε
While every mother closer to her breast
