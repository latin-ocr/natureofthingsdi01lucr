tion and 'intelli'genffl¹ from any modification of pure un-
conscious matter. I am thus,'’ concludes hc, ‘⁵ donbly
armed against the difficulty which is started by the
mateiialist: for if I be not altogether satislied with
the doctrine, that brutes are mere machiues, which
I think highly plausible, to say the least of it, I may
still shtlter myself under the theory of t ausmigra-
tion, and maintain that they are not mere matter.”
This double armour, however, with which the
Cardinal thus encumbers himself, proves, obviously,
that he places no great degree of confidence in either.
As to the Cartesian doctrine, which levels every class
and order of the brute creation to mere passive ma-
chines‚ intrinsically as inert as so many blocks of
wood, or clods of earth, it is in itself so outrageous
to the common appearances of nature, that few im—
materialists are disposed to give it countenance at the
present moment, whatever be the new difficulties in-
And
with respect to the doctrine of an instinctive prins

be endowed with this, as well as with any other

to which they plunge, by disavowing it.

power which it daily evinces, regarded as a separate
and specific faculty; no argument can demonstrate
why the Creator might not, by a general laW, deter-
mine that, in a certain state of modification, matter
should be specially gifted with a determinate portion
of absolute knowledge, pointing out to its possessor,
almost, or altogether from its birth, vibat to avoid
and what to pursue ; in the same manner as he has
ordained by another general law, and under another
modification, that no material being should be able
to acquire knowledge otherwise than by habit, edu-
cation, and industry, while, at the same time,
the knowledge thus obtained should be progressive
and unlimited. But it is by no means absolutely
certain, that all the various orders of animal life do
not submit to as regular a system of education in the
attainment of knowledge, as man himself. Lord
Monboddo‚ Dr. Darwin, and many other physiolo-
gists, have advanced various plausible facts and ex-

periments, in ord-:r to prove that every animal is as
much indcbted for the information of which hc is
possest, to habit, imitation, and industry, as any one
of the human race. The knowledge of brute: does
not, indeed, appear to be very progressive; but
their powers of acquh·i11g improvement are infinitely
small in comparison with those of mankind · and
even these latter, in a state ofpuve, uncivilized na-
ture, exhibit few superior proofs of progression be-
yond the brute creation itself. The Kamsehadale,
the Eschimaux, and the Caffrc, are at this moment
exactly the same as they were on their first discovery ;
and the bullinch, who is deprived of the common ma-
terials with which she consti-ucis her nest, would pro-
bably, with more ease, select a new assortment, than
any one of these savages providebimself with a hovel,
if deprived of the mud and weeds of which he ordi-
narily builds it.

As to the doctrine of transmigration, to which the
Cardinal flies, as his second reson, its absurdity
renders it as little a subject of belief in the present
day, as that of the mere mechanism of brutes; uor
would it, by any means, answer his purpose, if em-
braced For what, it might be inquired, are to
become of these genii or spirits that inhabit the
bodies of brutes, and are imnzortal in their own nti-
ture, at the destruction of the world ? Mamer, again,
being in every state of organizntion‚ according toln<
own system, equally passive and iuert ; aud vegeta-
bles, and even minerals, being in every instance ne>
tuated in the facultics they evince, by the same sti-
mulus as brutes, it follows that the same kind of ge-
nius or spirit that inhabits the body ofa dog, must
also reside in that of the miniosa, or theinagnet5
without the possession of which, neither os them
could manifest their respective and peculiar proper-
ties. So that, upon this latter hypothesis, every
brute, every vegetablc, and cury mineral, nay, every
fragment of every mine-rol, and every particle cf mat-
ter at large, must necessarily pro-:e the mansion of an
immortal and immaterial spirit ς without the cnergy
