iv PREFACE.

correct edition, with similar engravings‚ was proposed at Paris about
ten years ago ε but the politica! troubles in which France has ever since
been involved, have prevented it from being carried into execution.

The translation of “ The Nature of Things‚'¹ however, forms not the
whole of the poetical labours of Marchetti 3 for he published‚ in 1707,
a version of the odes of Anacreon in quarto ; and left behind him, in
manuscript, a complete translation of the AEneid in ottava rima, and
an unfinished philosophie poem, written in imitation of Lucretius
and Empedocles, upon Tira NATURE or TmNGs, adapted to the
latest discoveries‚ and the most approved modern systems. It was to
this work hc intended to have prefixed the beautiful dedication to
Lewis the (ii-eat, which the Abbe Arnaud alludes to in his Journal,
and conceives to have been designed for his translation of Lucretius.
It is much to be regretted, that Marchetti did not live to complete
this, which appears to have been his favourite, poem, and upon which
he had laboured with close application for many yearS. It is seldom
that so large a share of poetic and mathematical talents concentrate in
the same person. Signora Borghiui, who had been a diligent pupil of
the professor's, and had as successfully followed him in the study of
poetry as of the mathematics, pays him the following compliment in
one of her Canzonets, a collection of which was afterwards published

nt Naples, and dedicated to her preceptor himself:

Pero che dentro saggj, eccelsi‚ e santi
Carmi, con nuovo stile, e sovrumano.
Principj ignoti, e meraviglie ascose
Chiari per te vedransi 3 e se davanti

A te si dolcemente il gran Romano
Scrisse DELLA NATURA DELLE Cosr.³
Di pisi degne e famose

Opre tu rieto andrai, che al vero lume
Sciogli per l’alta via sicure piume.
