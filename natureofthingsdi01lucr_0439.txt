THE NATURE OF THINGS. 291

Deem not thou,

When aught of substance black or white the view

Solicits obvious‚—deem not, in the germs

745

Of embryon matter, black or white inheres,

Or aught besides of tint, where aught occurs,

Rousing the vision ; since the seeds of things

Live void of colours actual or conceiv'd.

This shouldst thou doubt, contending nought exists

750

Through the wide world but must evince some hue,

The doubt flows groundless.

He, whose sightless orb

Ne'er drank the day enlighten'd, still perceives

Whate'er exists though tints elude his ken.

Hence not essential colours to the form

755

Of things created: frequent e’en ourselveS,

itself ;—and that all its variations and hues result from
different reflections or refractions of the solar beam.
Having fully established this truth by facts and ar-
guments, which reach to verse 846, he next pro-
ceeds, in a more cursory manner, to observe, that
bodies are equally devoid of all other secondary qua-
lities, mund, smell, warmth‚ and moisture, as they
are of colour : ancl that nothing actually attaches to
them but their primary properties of solidity, figure,
extent, number, motion, or rest. Throughout the
whole of which, indeed, he is supported by the still
existing creed of Epicurus, who thus expresses him-
sels in his epistlc to Herodotus z και μην, και τας ατό-

particles of bodies are not to be conceived of as pos-
sessing any external qualities whatsoever, exceprting
form, weight‚ magnitude, and those which neces-
sarily result from its peculiar configuration ; for every
other kind of quality, as colour, for example, and
heat, entirely results from their different combina-
tions‚ and consequently change as these change.’'
