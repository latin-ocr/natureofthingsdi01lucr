THE NATURE OF THINGS.

‘267

Her the sage bards of GREECE, in ancient song,

Paint drawn by lions in a car sublime:

Hence, teaching hoW, in ether pois’d‚ she hangs,
Unpropt by aught beneath3 the savage beasts

They yok’d, and rein'd, to demonstrate how sure.

error ofDryden, orbis transcribers: “ haec dea leoni-
bus vehitur, validis, impetu, &c.'’ L. i. c. 21. “ This
goddess is drawn by lions, animals renowned for their
fire and impetuosity. These are qualities which are
attributed to the heavens, within whose circumfe-
rence is contained the air, that sustains and carries
forwards the earth.'' The motive assigned by Lucre-
tius is, however, much more pertinent and natural.

Ver. 608. -——in ether pois’cl‚ she hangs
Unpropt by aught beneath ,· ]To this coup-
let and opinion of Lucretius, Ovid refers, in that
well-known passage of his Metamorphoses z

 

Nec circumfuso pendebat in a'e're tellus
Ponderibus librata suis. L. i.
Ere earth, self-balanc’d, was in ether hung.
Whence, perhaps, Milton:
And earth, self-balanc’d, on her centre hung.

The sublime author of the Book of Job has a
passage perfectly parallel, Ch. xxvi. 7.

'irin-‘79 nm: rim
nuru · ὃν rm nbi-1
He stretcheth forth the north-pole out of chaos,
He hangeth the world upon nothing.

The north or north-pole (]193') is here used sy-
nechdoehally for the heavens at large, the inhabi-
tants of Idumaea knowing nothing of the south.
The second verse of this beit or couplet, has gene-
rally been supposed to refer to the creation of the
world out of nothing3 but it is hence obvious, that
it rather alludes to the cosmology of Idumam, or of
Egypt3 from the latter of which countrits, it is
probable, that the philosophers of Greece derived
the doctrine before us.

Achilles Tutum, a Platonist, and historiari of the
sixth century, gives us the following exemplificatum uf

610

the manner in which the earth is thus suspended:
“ Pnt,” says he, “ a single seed ofmillet, or grain of
any thing similar, into a bladder, and blow the bladdcr
gradually full of air, and the seed or grain will be
carried up, and retained in the middle of it. In the
same manner, the earth, being on all sides pressed
upon equally by the air, remains suspended in its
centre.'' ln Arat. Phaenomen. This method of phi-
losophizing, however, cannot but reinind us ofithe
Indian story of the elephant and the turtle ς and is
nearly as deficient in its powers of explanation.

A very different, and certainly a more poetic, if
if not a more philosophie account, is offered by Lu-
cretius, in its proper place, viz. Book V. 556, and fol-
lowing, of the present version 3 in which the reader will
find a most elegant and complete developement of the
Ptolemaic system. In the mean time, Ι cannot avoid
noticing‚ how strictly and exquisitely Camoens, who
has adopted the same astronomic hypothesis, has ad-
hered, in a variety of instances‚ to his great origi-
nal. A single passage shall suffice for the present:

Qual a materia seja nao se enxergri,
Mas enxergasse bem que esta composto
De varios orbes, que a divina verga
Compos, e hum centro a todos so tem posto z
Volvendo, ora se abaxa, ora se erga,
Nfica sergue, ou se abaxa, e hum mesmo rosto
Por toda a parte tem, e ern toda a parte
Comega a acaba, em firn por divino arte.
, CAN‘r. x.
The frame etherial various orbs compose,
In whirling circles now they fell, now rose ;
Yet never rose nor fell, for still the same,
W'as every movement ofthe wondrous frame;
Each movement still beginning, still complete,
Its author's type, self-pois’d, perfection's seat.
