502 . DE RERUM* NATURA. Lus.. 111.

Dissolvant animi magno se angore, metuque.

Tu quidem, ut es, lecto sopitus, sic eris, aevi
Quod super est, cunctis privatus doloribus aegris:
At nos horrifico cinefactum de prope busto
insatiabiliter deflebimus; aeternumque 920
Nulla dies nobis moerorem e pectore demet.

loved me. As I return from the field or the flock,
joyfully ye throng together, and call to me from
the sill of the d00r3 and, clinging round my knees,
receive, with c'mmish rapture, the little presents 1
bring you—O how does your pure and innocent hap-
piness transport me !‘’

If our poet had his eye directed towards Homer

in the former part of this pathetic dirge, it is at least
equally probable that, in composing the verses, of
which these now cited are a transiation, he was not
without recollecting the following lines from the same
exquisite muse :

Αλλα με memma χυτη κατα. ’γαια καλυπτοι,
’ Πριν γ’ ετι σης τε 33ης σου δ” &unffi-amo πυθεσθσιι.

May I lie cold before that dreadful day,
Prest with a load of monumenta} clay.
Thy Hector, wrapt in ever-laning sleep,
Shall neither hear thee sigla, nor see thee weep.
Poris.
There is also a passage in Virgil, so perfectly simi-
lar, that it is highly probable either Homer or Lucre-
tius furnished him with the first conception of it :

Tum me confectum curis, somnoque gravatum
Infelix habuit thalamum pressitquejaceutem
5Dulcis et alta quies, placidaque simillima moni.
ᾹΞΝ. vi. *323-
Then, freed from cares, the funeral couch pos-
sess'd
My weary limbs, and lull’d to quiet rest 3

To swcet, unbroken slumber, sound as death
When, in soft whispers, he demands the breath.

In the following exquisite and pathetic verses from
the well-known epitaph on Bion by Moschus, the
same metaphor of sleep, eternal sleep‚ is admirably.

is highly spirited, and entitled to much praise ς
though, in some measure, too araphrastic :

The meanest herb we trample in the field,

Or in the garden nurture, when its leaf

At winter’s touch is blamed, and its place

For-gottern, soon its vernal buds renews‚

And, from shbrt slumber, ‹wakes to life again.

Man ‘makes no more! Man valiant, gloriouS, wise‚

When death once chills him, sinks in sleep profimnd,

A long, unconscious, never-ending sleep.

Spencer has betrayed an obvious imitation of this
beautiful address of Lucretius, in the following
verses. Eut this is by no means wonderful; for we
have often already detected him exploring our sub-
lime hard for elegant description, and pathetic sim-
plicity :

He there doth now enjoy eternal rest,

And happy ease, which thou dost want, aud clave,
And further from it daily wanderest :

What, if some little pain the passage have,

That makes frail flesh to sear the bitter κνᾶν( ἒ
