lxvi THE LIFE OF LUCRETIUS.

such was Epicurus himself. Thus, in the opening of a letter addressed
to a favourite disciple z ‘⁶ Believe, besbre all things, that God is an im-
mortal and blessed bcing3 aS, indeed, common sense should teach us
concerning God. Conceire nothing of him that is repugnant to bles-
sedness and immortality, and admit every thing that is consistent with
these perfectionsf*⁵’' This belief of Epicurus is, indeed, aeknowledged
by ancient writers in general: Cicero expressly tells uS, that he was
punetilious in the discharge of his religious duties ·*3··; and Seneca, that
he worshiped God on account of his most excellent majesty and su-
preme nature alone, without any idea either of future reward or pu-
nishment ζ.

He admitted, moreover, the existence of orders of intelligences, pos-
sessed of superior powers to the human race, whom, like the angels
and archangels of the Christian system, lie conceived to be immortal
from their nature; to have been created anterior to the formation of
the world, to be endowed with sar ampler faculties of enjoyment than
mankind, to be formed of far purer materiaIS, and to exist in sar hap-
pier abodes. The chief difference which I have been able to disecrn
between the immortal spirits ofthe Epicurean system, and of the Chris-
tian theologist, is, that while the latter are supposed to take an active
part in the divine government of the world, the former are represented
as having no kind of connexion with it : since it was coneeircd by Epi-
curus that such an interserenee is absolutely beyond their power,

and would be totally subversive ot' their beatitude {-

In the passage immediately subsequent to that I have just quoted,
he purposely and obviously diseriminates them from the Supreme Be-
ing, whom he speaks ofin the singular number, and consequently re-
