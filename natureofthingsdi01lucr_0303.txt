Booxc I. THE NATURE OF THINGS. ’ 155

Attend, benignam, while we next decide

Their number, or if infinite ; and tell,

Since vom throughout exists, assigning space

For place and motion, if th’ ENTIRE of things 1015
Be bounded, or unfathom'd, and immense.

Th' ENTIRE of things, then, bounds can never know :

Else parts possest of farthest and extreme.
But parts can only be extreme, beyond
VVhere other substance springs, those parts extreme 1020
Binding, though sense the limit ne'er can trace.
If, then, some other substance rise, the first
Forms not th’ ENTIRE of things. Whate'er it be
That other substance still must part compose.
Vain too is distance: the vast whole alike 102 5
To all extends, embracing, and embrac’d.
Yet grant th' ENTIRE of things of bound possest.
Say, to what point shall yon keen archer, plac’d

E'en on its utmost verge, his dart direct Ρ
