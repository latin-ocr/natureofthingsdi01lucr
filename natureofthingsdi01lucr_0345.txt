THE NATURE OF THINGS.

Benign attend, while thus the muse explains.

Doubtless no substance boasts a bond within

Infflssoluble, since each gradual wasteS,

And, in the lapse of time, flies‘ off entire,

By age o'erpower’d. Yet the great mass of things

Still meets the view uninjur'd‚ from the stores

Sustain'd of primal atoms.

These, as oft

Their punctual ssight they take, each form decrease‚

And, as they join, augment: hence things attain

Their growth mature, and thence their sure decay.

Thus, void of rest, the changeful world renews,

And man on man lives mutua13 nations thus

Flourish, or fade3 a few brief years roll round,

And sire to son, through ev’ry reasoning rank,

Cartes, while that of Sir Isaac Newton was com-
pletely in opposition to him, which, in strict conso-
nance with the doctrine of Epicurus, regarded all
matter whatever as equally affected by gravity‚ and
as falling with equal velocity in a vacuum: an opi—
nion which has since been unequivocally confirmed
by experiments with the air-pump. In consequence
of this opposition‚ and ofthe growing reputation of the
Newtonian theory, Gassendi does not appear to have
drawn many philosophers into his own system3 and the
generality of materialists are now rather disposed to ad-
mit of an equal constraint existingin the operations of
body and mind, than to fatigue themselves with search-
ing farther for any occult cause of discrepancy.

It becomes meto state, before Ι close this note,

that, excepting this single conjecture of the declina-
tion of atoms, the doctrines, maintained and illus-
trated in the book before us, are erected upon the
most solid reasoning, and confiimed by the assent
and experiments of the sagest philosophers of modern
times. It is, as Ῑ have before observed, the system
of Sir Isaac Newton himself3 and the arguments ad-
vanced are those with which he combated the hypo-
thesis of Des Cartcs. We cannot but be astonished at
the force and perspicuity with which they are urged,
and the ea tent of philosophie knowledge they evince-
