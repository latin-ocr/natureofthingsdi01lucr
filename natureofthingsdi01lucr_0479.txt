In dulcet drops descends of genia] rain

And the bland EARTH impregnates.
Rises the glossy blade, the joyous leaf

Timely, then,

Shoots forth, and man and beast, in countless tribes,

F ed from the various banquet of the fields,

Live their gay hours, and propagate their kinds.

Maternal, hence, is EARTH most justly nam’d.

Thus all things rise, thus all again return :

Earth takes what earth bestow’d3 and back to heaven,

is the same idea conveyed by the Psalmist, lxviii. 8.

The earth shook ; the heavens also dropped ;
Even Sinai itself at the presence of God,
At the presence of God, the God of Israel.

Ver. 1009. Maternal, hence, &c.] On this subject
the poet descants more at large in Book V. 810, and
following; where the same idea recurs almost in the
same words; as it also does in Book V. v. 838.

It is to this and the ensuing verse that Klop-
stock appears to have had his eye directed, in the
opening of the third book of his Messiah3 and hia
Paraphrase is truly beautiful :

Sey mir gegriisst! ich sehe dich wieder, die du
m÷ch gebahrest,

Erde, mein miitterlich land, die du mich in kulen-
dem schoosse

Einst bey den schlafenden Gottes begrbibst, und
meine gebeine

Sanft bedeckest.
Once more I hail thee, once behold thee more,
Earth ,Ι soil maternal! thee, whose womb of

These limbs shall sink in soft and sacred rest.

Ver. 1010. Thus all things rise, thus all again return :
Eat-th takes what earth bestow’d; and, back
to heaven, &c.] Epicharmus has a passage
to this effect, which, it is probable‚ our poet had in
his recollection, when he composed these verses:
Συνεκριθη, observes lle, of the dead man, και ἒιεκςιθη,
και απηλθεν ὅθεν men, παλιν· ‘yx μεν ες γῆν, meusim δε avo.
‘⁶ The component substance is now decomposedr
and returned to the different quarters whence it
sprang ; its earthy parts to earth, its spirit to heaven
above.’' In the following verses of Euripides, the
same idea, and probably derived from the same
source, more nearly still approaches the passage of
Lucretius new under our consideration :

09⁵» ἒε {xxa-505 ες το φημ’ &Dus-ro,
Εν rau? απηλθε· *tenvia-z μεν προ,- αιέερα,

Το σωμα. 35 ες γῆν.

WVhen man returns to matter, whence he rose,
He severs total ; to the heavens ascends
The spirit, and the grossa· corse to eaith.

The doctrine was entirely that of Epicurus ; and Du
Rondelle has hence attempted to prove that Epicurus,
notwithstanding a host of expressions apparently to
the contrary, was, in reality, a believer in the inimor-
tality of the saul. But such a deductiori is altogether
saucifuh aud completei) disproved by the whole oi
Book lll- of the pue-in before us.
