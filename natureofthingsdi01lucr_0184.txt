DE RERUM NATURA.

Et si praeterea tamen esse Acherusia templa

Ennius aeternis exponit versibus edens:

QUO neque permanent animae, neque COI‘POl‘a HOStl‘a;

Sed quaedam simulacra, modis pallentia miris ε

Unde, sibi exortam, semper florentis Homeri

a few fragments, and detached smtences‚ occasionally
quoted by authors who were his countrymen. These,
however, are generally quoted with an admiration of his
abilities ; and give us a high opinion of him as a phi-
losopher, if not as a poet. Mr. Wakefield has ha-
zarded a conjecture, that the few lines in this passage
of Lucretius, which relate to Ennius, comprize the

very words which he himself made use of ς but this is ’

conjecture alone. This earliest of the heroic poets
of Rome, and who was by birth a Neapolitan‚ in-
structed the praetor, Marcus Porcius, in the Greek
language, at Sardinia, during the consulate of Titus
Qintus Flaminius and S. AElius Paetus Catus.
After the Romans had subdued this island, Cato in-
duced his tutor to reside at Rome, where he died in
the 70th year of his age, and was interred in the
family tomb of the Scipios, by whom, also, he had
been largely patronized. At different periods of his
life he wrote a variety of satires, comedies‚ and tra-
gedies3 but his grand poem on the Carthaginian
war, comprizing an extent of twelve books, was
not concluded till about three years before his

death.

Ver. 136. Os Acunum& temples‚—] The
word templa, in the Latin, is occasionally used by
most of the poets to signify any large space or ca-
vity. Thus the fragments of Ennius contain “ cae-
rula coeli templa,’' the cerulean concave of heaven.
Thus, again, Terence, in his Eunuch, “templa
And Lucretius employs the same term,
in a similar sense, in an almost infinite variety of

other places. “ Terriplum,'' in this respect, seems

perfectly synonymous with the Hebrew term “ Beth,'’

which, when applied to the supreme Being, means a·
temple strictly so called ι but, at other times, a
house, tent, or excavation of any kind. The He*
brew character, denominated Beth, is a happy symbol,
as Mr. Allwood hasjustly observed, of this idea. It
is written 2, and is an excavation, with one end open
for the purpose of receiving air.

Ver. 136. —whe›·e, nor saul
Nor body dwdls, ] Whenever, among
nations of but small refinement and civilization, the.
idea is credited, that man is a compound being, pos—

 

sessed of a corporeal body or substratum, and a some-
thing incorporeal, superadded to the body, and ca-
pable of surviving its dissolution, it, in no instance,
occurs to thern, that this other substance is itself di-
visible‚ and capable of existi'ng· in. different places,
and in different modes of existence, at the same period
of time. Pythagoras, who derived much of his ina
struction from the sages of Egypt, never imagined
the human constitution, any more than the brute, to
be possessed of more than two constituent principles„
It is the common doctrine, if we may credit any of
the accounts of travellers and historians, entertained,
at this day, among the American Indians, and the
inhabitants of New Zealand, and generally among
those of the Southern Islands. But this simple divi-
sion οξ man into two parts has not satisfled the caprice
of all nations, or of all philosophers. Brutes, it has
been urged by such persons, have a soul and a body 3
but man is intrinsically superior to brutes. He must,
therefore, possess some essential addition to such a
constitution. He must have a reasoning spirit, as
well as an animal seul, aud. a body susceptible of ἀε-
