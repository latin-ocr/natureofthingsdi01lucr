THE NATURE OF THINGS.

Then, too, spontaneOUS, from the soil she rear’d

Those luscious fruits, those vines that gladden life ;

Oannes, the chief god of the Babylonians and Chal-
deam, and the Dagon of the Canaanites, are often re-
presented with the body of a man, and the tail osa
fish; a figure precisely similar to that which the
Hindus bestow upon their own deity Veeshna‚ during
his incarnation, which comprizes the first avater of
their chronology.

The sorm of the ark was a source of additional
idolatry‚ and laid the foundation for worshipping al-
most every thing that was possest of a circular, or
crescent shape. Hence, the adoration pald to the
moon, or to Venus Demeter, under the appellation
of Diana3 hence the representation of Isis, the
Venus Demeter of Egypt, with a crescent upon her
head, and the reverence on her account universally
paid to the cow, as well as the apis, or bull, both
which animals, from the crescent curvature of their
horns, were dcemed sacred to herself.

The clement on which the ark floated, as well as
the form of the ark itsels, was also an object of ido-
latrous veneration ς and when, after the dispersion of
the Cushites, in consequence of their idolatry on
the plains of Shinar, one branch of them travelled
towards Egypt, and another towards Hindu, they
equally carried with them the worship of water,
and transferred the rites to which they had been
accustorned, to the Nile and the Gange& They re-
garded the annual inundation of these rivers as a type
ofthe universal deluge ; and the fertility which ensued
upon their subsiding, as an emblem of the renewal
of the world; and were punctilious in their de-
votions to these extraordinary streams‚ as well on
their rise as their fall. From the Nile, the Indus*
aud the Ganges, this river-worship was propagated
to other streams, till, under the creative imagination
of the Greeks, the minutest rill was supposed to be
an object of divine adoration, and to be actuated by
a peculiar genius, or godhead. Hence too, among·
the Egyptians more especially, the veneration that
was paid to the Ibis, which is only another name for
the ark, and which was an aquatic fowl of the crane
kind, highly useful among themselves from its destroy-

ing locusts, canker-worms, serpents, and other noxious
animals, with which their country was infested.

This deification of the ark and its builder, as well
as the clement that sustained them both, has enriched
the vocabulary of almost every mythology, but par-
ticularly that of Greece, with a vast variety of
terms, as well as laid the foundation for a long cata-
logue of proper names of the: most celebrated persons
and places. Among· the ChaideaQ there were two
terms more particularly employed to signify an ark,
or water-vessel‚ and these are Erech and Men z from
the former, or Erech, are derived Erecca, Arecca,
Argo, Argos, Areas, Arcadia, Archon, and all their
infinitude of compounds : while the Chaldaic radical
itself is still retained among the Northern nations in
the term Erich, Hemic, Henricus ; and affords our-
selves‚ as well as many other European tribes, a basis
for the terms arc, a segment ofa circle, being the
form of the vessel fabricated by Noah, and ark, the
vessel itself. From the latter appellation‚ Men, are
deduced Menes, Menu, Minos, Manes, Meon, and
Moon ; this last term, like the word arc, alluding to
the construction of the vessel, and, in the first in-
stance, applied to this planet in her crescent form

alone.
Among the ancient Egyptians, with whom one

branch of the family of Ham settled almost imme-
diately after their dispersion from Babylon, occupy-
ing the valley, which, from their own family name,
Cushites, or descendants of Chus, was denominated
Cushen, or Goshen—the term for an ark, or water-
vessel, was m (Hip), and this term seems to have
been also immediately impressed into the sacred ser-
vice of arkite mythology. The holy appellati0n‚ hip,

Ῑῃ, or ark, was applied to the water-fowl, most
useful to these people, which was, in consequence.
denominated Hibis, or Ibis. The Aphrodite, Venus·
Demeter, or mother of gods and men, was denomi-
nated Hippodamia: and in Arcadia there was an annual
festival, in honour of Neptune, who was no other
than the Egyptian Osyris, or Noah sailing over the
world of waters in the sacred hip, or ark, denominated
