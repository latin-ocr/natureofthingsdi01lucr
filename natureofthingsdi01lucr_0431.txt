Boon. 11. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 2⁹83

Be BAechs wine, its vulgar source forgot,
And e'en this mass of senseless earth define 670 v
Parent of gods; no harm ensues,——·but mark,
’Tis fiction all, by vital facts disprov’d.
Thus varies earth in product ; and, alike
In prima] seeds, thus varies all she bears.
The steed‚ the steer‚ the fleecy flock that range 675
Beneath the same pure sky, from the same fount
Their thirst that quench, and o’er the flow’ry lawn
Crop the same herbage, differ still, through time,
In form generic ; each parental stamp
Retaining close, from sire to sire propell’d. 680
Such the vast Variance of primordial seeds;
Through every herb, through every fountain such.
Each form, moreo’er, of animated life
Cornpounded‚ fiows from muscle, bone, and nerve,

Vein, heat‚ and moisture3 yet e’en these comprize 685
