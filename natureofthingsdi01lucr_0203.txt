Crushing the living substance, or within

Deep entering each interstice, to dissolve

All active, Nature no destruction views.

Draw the meet foods to nurture, and mature ?

Whence springs and rivers, with perpetual course,

Sir Isaac Newton supposes an ether surrounding
the atmosphere of planets, and subtile enough to
penetrate the pores of all bodies whatever3 most of
the phenomena of which he imagines to depend upon
its powers.
nates it a subtile or etheri-al medium. Des Car-tes,

In consequence of which, he denomi-

in like manner, admits a species of ether, which he
calls “ materia subtilis ;'’ and which, consistently
with his doctrine of an universal plenum, he conceives
not only adequate to pervade, but actually filling all
1116 vacuities of bodies. But the ether of the ancient
poets and philosophers much more nearly resembles
the congregation of hydrogen or inflammable air of
modern chemists3 and which, almost to a certainty,
according to some late chemical experiments, floats on

1116 a'c'rial atmosphere of the globe‚ and seems to realize

dus. Hydrogen is determined by Mr. Cavendish‚
to be ten times lighter than common air: according
to the laws of gravitation, it must, therefore, be con-
tinually ascending through it, and resting above it 3
for there is no more reason for supposing it should
be restrained‚ or combined with it in its passage,
than for supposing that air must be restrained or
combined in its passage through water. Thus dis-
engaged, and freed from all pressure, this volatile
gas necessarily then expands to inconceivable tenuity ;
and accumulating‚ as from its own levsty, :nd the
motion of the 631111, it must do, principally over the
pole3‚ it is probably 1116 cause of firc-balls, northern
lights, and many 011161 phenomena which are ex·
