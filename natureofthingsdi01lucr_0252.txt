DE RERUM NATURA.

Lus. 1.·

Materies, varios connexus, pondera, plagas,

Concursus, motus, per quos res quaeque geruntur.

Porro, si nulla est frangundis reddita finis

CorporibUS, tamen ex aeterno tempore quaeque

Nunc etiam superare necesse est corpora rebus,

Quae non dum clueant ullo tentata periclo.

At, quoniam fragili natura praedita constant,

Discrepat, aeternum ternpus potuisse manere

Innumerabilibus plagis vexata per aevom.

Quapropter, quei materiem rerum esse putarunt

Ver. 686. Y el should we grant—] The verse in the
original corresponding to this, together with the six
subsequent, are removed by Mr. Wakefield to a prior
station, occupyingin the Latin from ver. 578 to 585,
and corresponding with the present version from ver.
63 1 to 638. For this alteration he bas the authority
of several very respectable copies ι but as the superior
weight of authority seems, nevertheless‚ to be in fa-
vour of the common editions, and no advantage ap-
pears to result from the change, I have taken the li-
berty of restoring the passage to its accustomed posi-
tion.

Ver. 693. Hence these who (leem, &eq The exist-
ence of elements, and their number, if they exist at
all, have been disputed in all ages ς and even the pre·
sent state of chemistry is unable to determine the
question. Among the Moderns, therefore, as among
the Ancients, sometimes fire, sometimes air, some-
times earth, and sometimes water, hasbeen considered
as the sole clement, or primary source of all thingS.
Sometimes two, moreover‚ of the substances com-
monly denominated elements‚ sometimes three, but
generally, at least, till of late years'‚ the whole four
have been regarded as equally entitled to the appella-
tion, and as equally simple and uncompounded: to
which a fifth aud even a sixth have been incidentally

added, namely eold and oil, both of them having at
times been conceived of as simple and substantial ele-
ments. To these various opinions I shall have occa..
sion to revert in the progress of this commentary ι
but at present our only concern is with fire.

Fire, in all probability, from its being the grand
agent in nature, and from the wonderful superiority
of its effects over the known properties of every
other clement, was regarded amongst most na·
tiens, in an early period of the world, either as the
creator and origin of all things, or, at least, the sub-
stance whence the Creator produced all things. Hence
the Persius, Ethiopians, Scythians and Carthagini-
ans in the Old World, and the Mexicans and Peru-
vians in the New, paid divine honours to fire itself,
or to the sun, which was esteemed the sublimest re-
presentation of this element 3 on the origin of which
worship see note on b. ii. 1 167. Zoroaster ordained
the erection of Pyrea, or temples dedicated to tire,
through all Persia. And even the Hebrews imagined
fire to be the grandest proof of the presence of the
Deity. Under this symbol he appeared to Moses on
mount Horeb ; and to the Hebrews at large on mount
Sinai, on the promulgation of the sacred law: and
under this symbol he evinced his protecting presence
every night, by assuming the form of a fiery pillar.
And, impressed with thisidea‚ they were ever anxious
