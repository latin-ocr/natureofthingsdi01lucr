Hanc veteres Graifim doctei cecinere poe'tae

sprays of roseS, and other flowers, her own immedi-
ate productions, were scattered round on every side,
and the priests and priestesses were overshadowed
with immense quantities of crescent, or circular gar-
lands.

Besides the name of Da-Meter‚ the ancients also
bestowed upon the Earth, after her apotheosis, the
additional appellations of Rhea, Ops, Cybele, and
Mother of Ida. And, perhaps, the whole of these,
like the term Da-Meter itself, were, originally, only
so many different titles conferred upon Isis, Aphro-
dite, οι· Venus. The first is said to be derived from
Ρεω (Reo) to flow, and, consequently, means asoun-
tain z “ the fountain, or first source of all things :''
but, from the admitted origin of Venus, is far more
applicable to her than to the Earth. It is, inore-
over, contende-d, that Pes· and Ζεω, the signification
of which are nearly alike, were convertible terms, the
latter being changed into the former by the use of
the Attio dialem and that they were derived from
the same Egyptian radical, whence the modern Copts
have acquired their ‘TCC and COQ, which still mean
“ to drink,'' or ‘⁶ partake of the fonntain.'’ But Zea,
Zei:c‚andDia,were,doubtless‚ applied toVenus3 and we
can have little hesitation, therefore, in admitting that
Rhea (Pu) was, in like manner, appropriated to her
originally; and, like Dat-Meter, was hence deduced as
a title for the deifice. Γπς or Earth. With respect to
thesecondterm,Ops(gOC{), there canbe no doubt, we
are told, that this is of arkite origin, and an early ap-
pellatiou of Venus: and that hence Pelopia, or Thya-
tira, which are commutable ier-ms for the same place,
was a city peculiarly dedicated to this goddess. It
is also asserted, that Cybele xobviously from Cir-Bel,
(- the temple ofBe1‚”) was only an additional appella-
that Bel
was vhe chief deity of the Syrians, and represented,

tion for Venus, Isis, or the arkite goddess:

like the Egyptians’ goq, under the form of a serpent
or dragon, which was, unquestionably‚ an arkite
emblem. From Bel, or Belial, the Greeks obtained
Βελιαρ, which, consistently with this system, is in-
terpreted by Hesychius Δρακων, Draco ι a remark
advanced by Mr. Allwood in support of the Bryantine
theory. As to the term Idaea Mater, it is still more
conspicuous, we are told, that this was deduced from
Venus, than either of the others. Ida was the name
of two mountains, one in Phrygia, and one in Crete z
on the former, Venus was fabled to have received the
judgment of Paris ; and the whole island in which the
latter was placed, was peculiarly consecrated to her
worship. Admitting the primary hypothesis, it
should seem to follow, from these observations‚ which
Ι have selected with some care, that the whole of
the names and titles of Γης, or the deified Earth,
were derived from Isis, or Venus, the earliest female
divinity pei-sonified by the idolaters of Babylon.

ing lines, as well asin many other places:

With turrets crown'd, on Ida's holy hill,

Fierce lions rein’d, and, curb'd, obey thy will.
DRYDEN.

In this passage, the common editions of Dryden's
translation give us tygers, instead of lions. virgil
himself, however, says nothing of tygers, and perhaps
the English version is only a typographic error.
Macrobius adds the following explanation to that of
our own poet : and confirins, in a greater degree, the
