THE LIFE OF LUCRETJUS. >rein

breathed into the body of Adam, in¹ consequence of which he bccanu-¹
a living soul, and by presenting it to us under some such modification
in every instance in which the dead are stated to have re-appearcd.

In reality, the difference between this hypothesis and that os

there are few ofthem who do not conceive that the seul, in its separate
state, exists under some such shadowy and evanescent form, and that,
if never suffered to make its appearance in the present day, it has thus
occasionally‚ appeared in earlier times, and for particular purposes„
Yet, what can in this manner become palpable to material senses must it—
self be material in its texture, otherwise it could produce no impression

is, that while the one denominatos it material, the other, but I think
less accurately‚ denominates it immaterial. From what source univer-
sal tradition may have derived the same idea of disembodied spirits I
pretend not to ascertain 3 the inquiry would, nevertheless‚ be curious,
and might be rendered important: its universality, independently os
the sanction afforded to it by revealed religion, is no small presump-

has been to conciliate discordant opinions, and to connect popular bc·

But to return to the subject before me. I have already observed,
that the Epicureans were addicted to religious abstractionS, and that
the great founder of the sect eomposed various treatises upon the du-
ties of piety and holiness These, according to Cicero, were possessed
