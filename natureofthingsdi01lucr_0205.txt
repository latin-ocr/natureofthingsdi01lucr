Boox Ι. ΤΗΕ NATURE OF THINGs. 57

KVhate'er could perish, ever-during time,
And rolling ages, must have long destroy’d.
But if, through rolling ages, and the lapse
Of ever-during time, still firrn at base,
Material things have stood, then must that base 270
Exist immortal, and the fates defy.
Thus, too, the same efficient force apply'd
Alike must all things rupture, if, within,
No substance dwelled eterna] to maintain
In close, and closer, links their varying bonds. 27 5
E'en the least touch‚—for every cause alike
Must break their temutes, equal in effect,
If no imperishable power oppos'd,--
E’en touch were then irrevocable death.
But since, With varying strength, the seeds within 280
Adhere, of form precise, and prove express
Their origin eternal,——free from ill,
And undivided must those forms endure,
Till some superior force the compact cleave.
Thus things to nought dissolve not3 but, subdu’d, 285

Alone return to elemental seeds.

Time with his own etemal lip shall sing.) In like manner, in the sacred writings we meet with
Ver. 38. the phrase, ‘⁶ eternal or everlasting hills.” Thus„

Habak. iii. 6. Ἶγ ’'mr-r ly'ifin'l

And again, in book vii. of the same poem ε

——virtue shall enrol your names He beheld andiscatter'd the nations;
In Time’s eternal records. The everlasting mountains were dispers’d;

V I Ver. 361. The perpetual hills bowed down.
