xxviii THE LIFE OF LUCRETIUS.

libraries of Aristotle and Theophrastus, contributed perhaps, more
than every other circumstance, to inflame the Roman people with a
love of Grecian literature. This was effected by the fortunate con-
quests of Sylla, and anteceded the public present of Lucullus, who,
from being a menial dependent upon, became a legate of the former, by
about fifteen years, consequently during the infancy of Lucretius.
These unrivalled libraries were the property of Apellicon of Teia, who
had accumulated an immense collection of boolxs of intrinsic value, at
an incredible expence. Apellicon does not appear to have been by

any means a scholar; but he was a man of prodigious wealth; and,
as it sometimes occurs in the present day, notwithstanding his igno-
rance of literature, a library was his hobby-horse‚ and the greater
part of his rental was expended in augmenting it. For this purpose,
he ransacked all the public and private collections of books in Asia;
he surpassed, in many insumens, the offers even of the emperors Eu-
menes and Mithridates, for volumes that were become scm-ce as well
as valnable ; and where he had not an opportunity of purchasing, he fre-
quently, by considerable prcsents, tempted the librarians to steal for
him. During the first war, however, between Mithridates king of
'Pontus and the Roman republic, in which Sylla eventually tri-
umphed, and acquired a high degree of personal glory‚ the city of
Athens had unfortunatcly united itsclfwith the Asiatic prince: and
hencc, at the conclusion of the war, was left totally at the mercy of
the Roman conqueror. Sylla appears to have thrown a most wishful
eye upon every thing ofintrinsic value that lay within his reach :—-and,
having sacrilegiously invaded the groves ofAcademus and the Lyceum,
the library of Apellicon was one ot· the next objects that captivated his
attention. He was determined to add it to his other treasures 3 but force
was now become unnecessary ; for, at this very moment, the book-worm
Apellicon died, and he met with no resistance from his relations ⁷¹.
