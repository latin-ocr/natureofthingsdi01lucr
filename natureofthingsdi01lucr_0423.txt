THE NATURE OF THINGS. 275

To fright th’ unrighteous crowds, and bend profound

Their impious souls before the pow'r divine.

Thus moves the pompous idol through the meets,

Scatt'ring mute blessings, while the throngs devout 6

for the general benefit of society, is not now an ob-
ject of inquiry: but it is an indubitable fact, that be-
fore mankind become tamed into a relish for civil so-
ciety and habit, education and example have taught
them to command their own feelings ; their passions,
as they are fewer, are more active, and of course
more easily worked upon by any consentaneous stimu-
lus whatever.

Music, then, when employed in the form of sim-
ple and unsupported melody, is a natural stimulus,
operating upon the constitution of inanimam, as well
as animate being-53 but far more impressively upon
the latter. And we perceive clearly why, in the

earlier and less cultivated ages of the world, the⁴

powers of melody were possest ofa much more ge-
neral influence than in the present day, even when
carried to its utmost degree of perfection. We per-
ceive, clearly, why the highland pipe, the reed of
Pan, the harp of Ossian, or the rude and barbarous
songs or instruments of the natives of Otaheite,
Africa, or America, should possess a greater enchant-
ment over their respective audiences‚ than the most
elaborate music of Europe over the more polished
societies to which it is addressed. The passions of
the former are strong-er, and they are sooner and more

violently affected by the application of general sti-
mulants of every kind.

Stin, however, in the present day, and resisted aa
it is by the present complicated system of passions
and manners, its effects are often too obvious to be
questioned. And Ι am confident, that the science
of melody might be much more effectually employed
by our modern empyrics in the extirpation ofa va-
riety of chronic diseases, than the occult and pre-
tended powerS, either of animal magnetisrn, or me—
tallic tractors. We need not recur for its effects‚
with the Platonic philosophers‚ to their anima mundi,
nor, with Baptista Porta, to magic ; its mode of in-
fluence is as obvious, and in definite circumstances. I

apprehend, as nnequivocal as those of gravitati0n‚ or
muscular motion.
