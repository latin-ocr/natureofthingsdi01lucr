THE LIFE OF LUCRETIUS. >lv

Rome ᾖξ’ esteeniing Lucretius the first: as ifhe had said, ‘⁵ Belcold another

great genius rising up amongst us, who will prove (1, second Luth'rius.”

The opinion of Cicero was inanifestly that of virgil, as is obvious
from his numerous attempts to copy or imitate hini through the whole
oshis various poenis: but the delicate complhnent before us, he ap-
pears to have treasured up with peculini· plcasure, and to have waited
with an eager desire to introduce the terms in which it was conveycd
with a dexterous sclicity of application; and we at length find, that
he has reserved it for the last book of his AEneid, where it is clegantly
and succcssfully employed in a description of the young Ascanius.
But Virgil has given a still more pointed instance than the present, of
his high opinion of the poetic talents of Lucretius, in the second book
of his Georgics. No classical reader can be ignorant of the admirable
digression on the pleasurcs of rural retirement, in conjunction with the
study of philosophy, with which this book concludes. Such was the
life, and such the pursuits of our poet ;—the thought seems suddenly
to have entered the mind of Virgil as he was writing——he instantly
drops his general description for an individual portrait; and, imitating
the very language of the character he meant to delineate, thus

abruptly bursts forth in his praise z

Fsmx ! qui potuit rerum cognoscere caussas,
Atque metus omnes et inexorabile fatum
Subjecit pedibus, strepitumque Acherontis avari †.

⁴ Magne spes altera Roma. It has been generally understood, till of late, that this exclamation of
Cicero, instead of referring to Lucretius, referred to himself. For this new interpretation, Ι am indebted
to the critical acumen of Dr. Warton ; and it is at once so ingenious and plausible, and so infinitely supc-
τίοι· to the former, that, Ῑ apprehend‚ it will be admitted by every scholar for the future. It equally takes
away the vanity‚ which cannot but attach to Cicero upon the old explanation, and the incongruity neces-
sarily resulting from confounding an eminent poet with an eminent orator. Ι am indebted‚ also, to the same
able expositor for the happy idea of applying to Lucretius the verses in a subsequent passage from the se-

cond book of the Georgics.
† How blest the sage ! whose soul could picrce each cause

Of changeful Nature, and her wond'rous laws ;
