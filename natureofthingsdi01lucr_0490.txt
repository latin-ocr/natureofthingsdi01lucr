DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. II.

Unica quae gignatur, et unica solaque crescat ;

Quin aliquoius siet secli, permultaque eodem

Sint genere : in primis animalibus indice mente

Invenies sic montivagum genus esse ferarum,

1080

Sic hominum geminam prolem, sic denique mutas

Squamigerfim pecudes, et corpora cuncta volantum.

Quapropter, coelum simili ratione, fatendum est,

Terramque, et solem, lunam, mare, caetera, quae sunt,

Non esse unica, sed numero magis innumerali;

1085

Quandoquidem vitae depactus terminus alte

Tam manet haec, et tam nativo corpore constant,

Quam genus omne, quod hiis generatim rebus abundans.

Quae bene cognita si teneas, Natura videtur

Libera continuo, dominis privata superbis,

1090

Ipsa sua per se sponte omnia diis agere expers.

Nam, pro sancta deum tranquilla pectora pace

Quae placidum degunt raevom,

multumque serenum ἔ

Ver· 1 102. These truths avow'd, all nature shines at
once,
Free in her acts, no tyran! to control,
Sels-potcnt, and unirfiuenc’d by the gods]
But by what gods is she uninfluenced, and from
whose tyranny is she now freed? Certainly, in the
first place, she is uniufluenced by, and totally liberated
from, that capricions and arbitrary tyranny to which
the gods of the people were supposed to be perpetu-
ally subjecting her: exciting storms to avenge this
man, and sun-shine to prosper that ; actuated by their
own passions‚ and unmindful of the common good.
From the tyranny of these capricious deities, it was
the laudable aim of Lucretius to represent the uni-
s

verse as for ever freed. But there were deifies, or
blesscd and immortal spim'ts, admitted under his own
system—spirits whose faculties were sar superior to

v those of mankind, yet who were, nevertheless‚ incom—

petent to create or govern the world. From the in-
adeqnate power and authority of these, therefore,
the poet, at the same time, assei-ts the world to be
liberated: for, which of them, he inquires, is able
to sustain the mighty labour, or fulfil the mysterions
purposes that are daily accomp'lishing? But surely
he meaned not to deny all divine control whatso-
ενα-5 for it was expressly affin-med by the Epicurean
philosophy, that matter in a disorganised state is to-
tally destitute of all sensation and intelligence ; that
