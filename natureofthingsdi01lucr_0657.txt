Boox 111.

The thoughtless maniacs oft indignant roar,

THE NATURE OF THINGS.

945

“ How short the joys of wine ! —e’en while we drink

“ Life ceases, and to-morrow ne'er returns !'’

As if, in death, the worst such wretches fear’d

XVere thirst unquenched‚ parching ev’ry nerve,

Or deem'd their passions would pursue them still.

950

Not anxious, thus, mankind the world resign

At evening hour when soul and body rest 3

And there's an end ς for ah ! you know
They drink but little wine below.

The Arabian poet Tarafa, however, surpasses
Anacreon infinitely in his devotion to the pleasures
of drinking; and, in the language of our poet, seems
literally afraid of unquenchable thirst after death.
It is thus he expresses himself in his Albecriyyo‚
one of the seven poems that, on account of their
merit, were transcribed in letters of gold, and sus-
pended, where indeed we should scarcely have ex-
pected to find a poem of this description, in the
temple at Meeca :

Fadhernei arawwei himetei fef hhayahhz't
Mekhz'ifaha shirbin' fei alhhayahi mosaarredi
Careimon' yorawwei nafsaho fef hhayzitihi
Setalamo in mutnz'i gadan‘ ayyona alsadei
‘¹ Suffer me, whilst I live, to drench my head
with wine, lest, having drunk too little in my life—
time‚ 1 should be thirsty in another state.
‘⁴ A man of my generous spirit drinks his full
draught to-day ; and to-morrow, when we are dead,

it will be known which of us has not quenched his
thirst.’' Sir W. Jones.

Ver. 946. “ e’en while we drink
“ Life ceases, ] Juvenal has elegantly imi-
tated this querulous and impertinent observation of
the drinking debauchee in the following verses:

 

 

Nunc mihi quid suades post damnum temporis, et
spes

Deceptas? Festinat enim decurrere, velox
Flosculus, angustae, miseraeque brevissima vitae
Portio : dum bibimus, dum ser-ta, unguenta puellas,
poscimus, obrepit non intellecta senectus.

Su. ix. 12 5.

Now what’s thy antidote for hopes destroy'd?

Time basely murder‘d ἓ pleasures unenjoy’d ?

Lo ! the brief blossom hastens to decay

That‚ mid its suffering-3, soothes life’s little day.

E’en while we driuk, while girls and garlanda*
cheer,

And flowing ointments-ideot age is here.

Ver. 949. —thirst unquenched, parching every

nerve‚] This metaphorical mode of express—
ing the effect of extreme thirst is by no means un-
common, either in ancient or modern times. Thua,

Ovid ε

⁴Copia nulla famem relevit: sitis arida guttur
Urit.

 

Μετ. xi. 129.

No store contents him ς thirst :mqucnched still
Burns all his throat.

And Mr- Cumberland‚ in his Calvary. describing
the punishment of Satan:

Panting he roll’d in streame of scalding sweat,

Parch’d with intolerable lhirst ,· one drop

Of water theu to cool his raging tongue-

Had been a boon worth all his golden shrines.
