DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. ΙΙΙ.

Atque animae, claranda meis jam versibus esse;

Et metus ille foras praeceps Acheruntis agundus,

Funditus humanam qui vitam turbat ab imo,

Omnia subfuscans mortis nigrore3 neque ullam

Esse voluptatem liquidam, puramque, relinquit.

Nam, quod saepe homines morbos magis esse timendos

Infamemque felunt vitam, quam Tartara leti ; ,

Et se scire animae naturam, sanguinis esse,

that Butler appears to have parodied this verse of our
poet, in the following lines:

 

he profess'd

He had first matter seen undress'd 3

He took her naked, all alone,

Before one rag of form was on.

The chaos too, he had deser-ied,

And seen quite through, or else he lied.
Humanus-

This effusion of real wit will apply, however,
with, perhaps, more pertinency, to many of our mo·
dern cosmogonists, than to Lucretius, or Epicurus.

 

Ver. 39.
'Thosefmrs qfsuture torment that (ὕπ’-αεὶ

See, in note on ver. 19 of this Book, the comment
uf Bruno upon this, and a similar passage.

——there could I rest
And sleep secure, his dreadful voice no more
Would thunder in my ears, no fear of worse
To me, and to my offspring, would torment
With cruel expectation.
PAR. Les-r, Book X. v. 778.

The uncertainty of a future state, and more es-
pecially of the happiness or misery with which it
might be pregnant‚ produced, in many instances, an
undue dread of death among the philosophers of an-
cient times, and often embittered the life, and de-
stroyed the courage of the most worthy and the most

vii-tuous. A posterior existence was seldom accre-
dited without much hesitation and doubt ; and hence,
even among those who did admit the questionable
tenet into their creed, it was judged necessary to
fortify the mind against the approach of dissolution
by other considerations and arguments. Hence, by
some philosophers‚ the value of life was unnecessarily
depreciated ς its pleasures were represented as being,
even in their state of utmost perfection, unsolid, un-
satisfactory, and evanescent ; and life itself, as a gift
scarce worthy of the Supreme Giver; a possession
which might reasonably be resigned without regi-et.
While others, allowing to the pleasures of life the
full scope of their value, purposely abstained from
indulging in them, lest they should become so ena-
moured of existence as not to quit it, orgcven to en-
dure the thought of quitting it, without .h0rror.
They deadened their desires by a series of perpetual
abstinences and mortifications, till at length, by habit
alone, they lost all relish for enjoyment, and became
indifferent to every change that might chance to oc-
cur. Neit'ner of these, however, formed the system

of Epicurus: Conceiving that the arguments dedu-
cible from nature were considerably more cogent in

the disproof than in the support of a future exist-
ence, instead of suffering himself to become a perpe-
tual prey to the alternate preponderancies of hope
and sear, he boldly relinquished the doctrine alto-
gether ; and, freed from this anxiety, felt himself at li-
berty to calculare the real blessing and value oflife, as it
relates to the-presentworld. Instead of despising αἰεί·
