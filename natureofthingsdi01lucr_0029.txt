PREFACE. xv

obvious, has largely augmented my labours, but it was a trouble that

seemed imperiously demanded.

In attentively perusing the poem before ns, it is impossible to avoid
noticing the striking resemblance which exists between many of its
most beautiful passages, and various parts of the poetic books of the
Scriptures: and the Abho de St. Pierrc, as well as several other Con-
tinental writers, have hence conceived Lucretius to have been ac-

and largely partook of the liberality of the Egyptian monarch3 and
Sanctius seems fairly to have established it, that the labours of
the Grecian idyllist are deeply imbned with the spirit, and evince-
