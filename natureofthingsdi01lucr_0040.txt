body ot' philosophers and rhetoricians were expelled by a deeree of

Messala, in the year of the city 592. A general taste for Greeian
literature, nevertheless, still continued to prcdominate; and it was
considerabl)⁷ augmented towards the beginning ot' the seventh century
of the Roman aera, by a comparison between the true classical taste
which had been unilbrmly evinccd by these unfortunate scholam, and
the tribe of Latin sophists and ‹leclaiiners, who, in consequence ostheir
exile, sprang up, and began to usurp their place: men who were
bloated with conceit, instead of being inspired by wisdom, and who
