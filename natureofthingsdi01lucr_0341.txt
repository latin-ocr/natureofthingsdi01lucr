ΤΗΕ NATURE OF THINGS.

E'en in the noon men start at forms as void

Of real danger as the phantoms false
By darkness conjur’d, and the school-boy‘s dread.

A terror this the radiant darts of day

Can ne'er disperse: to truth's pure light alone,

And wisdom yielding, intellectual suns. ,ξ

Come, then, and mark how seeds primordia] form

Created things, and how, when form'd, dissolve z

To shoot secretly at the innocent.
Clandestinely shoot they, and are not seen.

In this version, Ι have followed the Syriae read-
ing, as confirmed by twelve MSS. So, Sol. Songs,
viii. 6. should be rendered

For love is strong as death

‘ And' jealousy cruel as the grave ;

Its flames are arrows of sire,

Which Jehovah kindleth in the heavens !

See the note on this passage in my version of the
Song of SongS.

Not dissimilar is the figure employed by St. Paul,
Rom. xiii. 12. ενὲυσωμεθα. τοι ὅπλα του Φωτος, “ Let us
put on the armour qs meust—Dante appears to
have had Lucretiusin view, when composing the fol-

lowing verses :

Or come ai colpe degli caldi rui
Delia neve riman nudo’l suggette,
E dal colore, e dal freddo primai ;

Cos} rimaso te nello intelletto
Voglio informar di luce si vivace‚
Che ti tremolera- nel suo aspetto.

Now, as when vernal Sol begins to glow,

Down sinks the wintry mass of drifted snow
From Nature's face before his burning gaze ;
Thus from your mind the darksome vest shall fall,

That hides your intellects in sombrous pall,
When truth divides the vale with piercing rays.

Ver. 63. Come, then, and marl· how q‘ceds prImordial

Created things, ] The poet now proposes

the immediate subject of the book before us-the

motion of elementary atoms, and the consequent
productiori of material things. He has already

traced their existence, and described them as float-
ing, 'not only through the ocean of the atmo-
sphere, but through the immense ocean of space;
and has in general terms asserted, what he now

 

undertakes to prove more decisively; namely‚ that
it is from peculiar combinations, and juxta-posi-
tions of these corpuscleS, that every material form
or conglomeration of forms is produced. Before
we enter upon an analysis of the theory invented
by Epicurus, to account for the express mode by
which such combinations, and juxta—positions of pri—
mary elements, take place, Ι cannot avoid noticing
that the writings of several modern philosophers,
and especially of those who have lately published
essays on the subject of meteoric stones, or sub-
stances which, in almost every quau-ter of the globe,
have been traced to have fallen from the Heavens,
have reverted‚ in a very considerable degree, to the
Epicurean theory, so far as we have hitherto ad—
vanced in considering it. and have added, in no
small measure, to its probability. It is now gene.

exist in a state of gass; that even gas-se« themselves
