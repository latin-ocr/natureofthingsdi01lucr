THE NATURE OF THINGS. 363

His weary head3 his thriftless pains bewails,

Thriftless 'too sure z and, while his wand'ring thought

animals and new vegetables of the same orders and
specieS, are continually springing up, it is true, and
new worlds may, in like manner, be created from the
ruins of the present. Why the individual systems of
animals and vegetables are not suffered to be thus
eternally recruited, we know not: but* there is,
through all creation, an express and determinate law
of nature, or the God of nature, that this individual
renewal of system shall not be perpetuated for ever.
The Christian, indeed, looks forwards, with joyful
hope, to a time when this law shall be done away :
when “there shall be new heavens, and a new
earth ;'' and “this mortal shall put on immortality :''
and the principles of sound and genuine philoso-
phy, as well as the veritable assurances of the sacred
ScriptureS‚ concur in justifying such an expecta-
tion. The former intimate to man, that such an
event may occur; the latter, that it most decidedly will.

There is, I knOW‚ a school of philosophers in
this country, as well as in France, who ridi-
cule every idea of this sort3 who, denying all evi-
dence adduced from revelation, and confining them-
selves solely to the experienced train of events, the
actual laws and phaenomena of nature, strenuously
contend‚ that there can be no such thing as a resur-
rection of the body. But what have these men of
wisdom substituted in its stead? Why, truly‚ that
nature, instead of degenerating‚ is becoming daily
more kindly and prolific3 and that the body itsclf‚
in its present mode of existence, is gradually attain-
ing an increase of longevity, and will, in a few gene-
rations, acquire the possession of complete immorta-
lity: that man is becoming, and will become, more
virtuous ; that the universal passions of the soul are
bending, by degree5‚ to the judgment and correction
of the mind; that perpetual health will, in conse-
quence, soon succeed to disease ; tranquillity to war;
the whole orb of earth be duly populated ;—and there
being no more necessity for the multiplicatiori of the
animal species, that the sexual organs themselves
will gradually disappear, and vanish! 1! And yet
these are the men who, discarding every thing mys-

terious, or acquired by super-natural revelation, pre-

tend, more than all others, to confine themselves to .,

the expericnced facts and events before thern l l!
But it is useless to pursue such fanciful and absurd
speculations any farthcr. They are undermined by
the very first principles on which such pretended
sages affect to bnild this philosophie Babel ε for what
one law,or phrenomenon of nature, can theyconjure up,
to countenance such unfounded and puerile assertions ἓ
Every mode and variety oslife‚ vii-tuous and vicious,
tranquil and tumultuons‚ temperate and luxurious,
has been alternately resorted to; but man, in every
instance, has still proved mortal. Every pretended
nostrum and elixir‚ for the prolongation of existence,
has been tried, and in many instances faithfully tried,
according to the rules of the empirical prescriben
but all equally in vain. Yet these new and philoso-
phie empirics boldly come forwards, and, though rigid
adherents to the laws of nature, and the experienced
train of events, without the adduction of any one
fact, and in direct contradiction to nature herself,
pretend to assem, that they have discovered this stu-
pendous secret 2—that life and immortality depend,
or will a few ages hence depend, upon the mere vo-
lition of the mind: and that the man, who ardently
desires to live, may, even in this world live for ever! 2
See Condorcet’s Essaie sur le Progres de l'Esprit
hnmain ; and Mr. Godwin’s Political Justice.

There is a greater degree of resemblance between
these equalizing philosophem, and that sect of Chris-
tians, who are denominated Millcnr1ar1'an, than either
are, perhapS, desimus of acknowledging. For in-
terpreting in too literal a sense, a passage in the Re-
velations of St. John, these latter are looking for-
wards with holy hope, to a period in which righte-
ousness and truth will prevail for a thousand years
over the whole earth, to the utter exclusion of vice,
error, andvevery mental and corporeal evil : a period
in which· the life of man will be elongated, and every
one exist in' ,t'he bonds of harmony and love. This
belief, which '1was common in the first ages of the
chureh, *phas never been without its adherents: and
