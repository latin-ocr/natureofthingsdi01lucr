cxx APPENDIX.

It is astonishing, indeed, to observe the ignorance of the school-
men, as to the real philosophy of EpicurUS, from a short time after
the commencement of the Christian aera, to the beginning of the fis·-
teenth century; for, excepting a few of the primitive Fathers of the
church‚ Lactantius seems to have been almost the only writer tolerably
instructed in its tenets. And, hence, almost every person who differed
in his philosophie opinions from the dogmas ofthe synods and ecumenic
couneils, was denominat-ed an Epicurean. Alexander, therefore, a
Christian, who is supposed to have flourished in the beginning of the

second century, was always looked back to as a disciple of this school,
because he maintained, if we may credit Albertus Magnus, that God
is matter, or does not exist independently of matter3 that all things
are essentially God, and that the figures of bodies are all imaginary

accidents, and have no real existence& David de Dinant‚ a Christian

philosopher of the thirteenth century, is reported to have espoused the
same tenetS, and is imagined by Bayle, to have been an immediate
disciple of another Christian philosopher of the same creed, of the
name of Amalric‚ who, in like manner, taught, that “ all things are
God, and God is all things, both the Creator, and the thing created ;'’
and whose body was preposterously dragged out of its grave, many
years after it had been quietly inhumed, and sentenced to the flames
for heresy †. These philosophers were both esteemed Epicureans in
their principles, as was also the celebrated Peter Abelard, who wielded
with so much reputation the weapons of polemio divinity‚ about half
a century before the oera of Dinant. Giordano Bruno has likewise oc-
casionally been ranked in the same catalogue: a bold and fantastie
