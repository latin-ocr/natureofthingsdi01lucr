THE NATURE OF THINGS. ἵ

And fruitful Barth, as round the Seasons roll,
With Life who swellest‚ for by thee all live,

 

personification of Venus by Cam'oens‚ is an imitation
of the present passage of Lucretius, whom the learned
annotator has, moreover, vindicated at the same time.
“ Por ventura‚'’ says he, “ que imito el pocta en
“ esta eleccion al grande filosofo Lucrecio, que re-
“ suelto a cantar de las produciones de la naturalezas
“ no invoco otra deidad sino a Venus, a quien la
“ filosofia antiqua attribuia 61 titulo de autora de la,
‘⁶ cosas alma Venus‚’' See. : to which he adds, “ I
“ esso sin memoria alguna de que Venus pro otro
“ lodo sea deidad lasciva 3 i por esso la invoca con ti-
“ tulo de pureza alma Venus, attendiendo a 105 oficios
“ licitos que ha de hazer en el poema en toda especie
“ de generacion: que es lo a que attendio nuestro
“ poeta haziendola autora de la produccion de la
‘⁶ christianidad, i policia en la Asia.”

Ι am never-theless afraid that Camo'ens cannot so
easily be defended as Lucretius, upon the point of
allegory 3 the Portuguese bard having inharmoniously
combined the mythology of the Greeks with the doc-
trines of the Christian church. Hence Mr. Mickle,
notwithstanding his defence of Camoens in this
respect, has thought proper in his version to smooth
away its more obnoxious prominences, by omitting,
in Gama’s prayer to the Supreme Being‚ his reference
to St. Paul rand the Israelites‚ and by concealing the
pagan term Vanus under the more general and ac-
cordant appellation of CELESTJAL LovE. Yet the
impropriety is not greater in thus blending the super-
natural agency of the Christian religion with the my-
thology of the Greeks, than in combining the former
with the Gothic machinery of magic and incantation ς
a practice that was common among Christian poets
in every country throughout Europe, till the sublime
and harmonious system first introduced by our own
Milton into his immortal and unrivalled epic. No
critic, however, has less right to be severe upon Ca-
moens than Voltaire, though no critic has animad-
verted so harshly3 for the former has not only intro-
duced the very same combination of machincry into
his Henriad, but has been guilty of the grossest in-

congruity in arranging it. Instead of following Lu-

cretius and Camoens, in representing the power of
Love as becalming every tempest and restoring tran-
quillity to nature, he has given to Love himself (to
Cupid instead of Venus), and in a poem founded
upon Christian tenets‚ the power ofexciting the most
terrible storms, and of unchaining all the winds and
all the lightnings of heaven : and in this manner alone
does he separate Henry of Navarre from his compa-
1110115, and conduct him to the residence of the fair
Gabrielle :

11 agite les airs que lui-meme a calmes ;

Il pade, on voit soudain les clemens arme's.

D'un bout du monde a l'autre, appellant les orages,

Sa voix commande aux vents d’assembler les nuages,

De verser les torrens suspendus dans les aiis,

Et d'apporter la nuit, la fondre, et les eclairs.

Hammo. Lir. 9.

The winds he maddens that he calm’d of late,

He speaks—and all is elemental hate.

From pole to pole his voice terrific flies,

Bids clouds o’er clouds, o'er tempests tempests 11561

Suspended torrents from their fountains fall,

And thunders, lightnings‚ night, usurp the ball.

With how much more elegance as well as classica!
propriety 15 this office allotted by Camo‘ens to old
Eolus ?

Yet it may bc obser-ved, that neither Voltaire nor
Camo'ens presumed to invocate Venus, or any other
of the Grecian deities, for poetic assistance, as Lu.
cretius has done at the commencement of this poem ε
but neither Voltaire nor Camo'ens had the same mo-
tive, otherwise there can be no doubt that each would
have followed the example thus set before them. In.
vocations‚ indeed, either to real or allegoric powers,
The

practice is of immemorial date; and the man who.

have been customary among poets in all ages.

would venture to begin a poeni of importance with-
out it, would be sure to incur the displeasure of the
Muses, and perhaps be adjudged guilty of a contempt
of court. Hence Vida, in his advice to his pupils,

observes, that the best poets of every period have
adhered tor this usage. ·
