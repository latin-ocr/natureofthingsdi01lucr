DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. Ι.

Quaerentem, dictis quibus, et quo carmine, demum

Clara tuae possim praepandere lumina menti,

Res quibus obcultas penitus convisere possis.

Hunc igitur terrorem animi tenebrasque necesse est

Non radiei solis neque lucida tela diei

Discutiant‚ sed Naturae species, Ratioque t

Quoius principium hinc nobis exordia sumet3

NULLAM REM E NIHILO GIGNI DIVINITUS UMQUAM.

At each blest touch, and, on the lowliest things,
Scatters her rain-bow hues.
B. ii. 250.
Having thus had occasion to introduce into the same
note the names of my two friends, Mason and Delille,
I cannot avoid adverting to the extraordinary coinci-
dence of taste, time, and subject, which subsists be-
tween their respective and exquisite didactic poems.
The period in which they wrote was during the Ame-
rican war: to this they both allude, and incline to the
same side of politics. The subject of their poetry is
Picturesque Gard‘ening: the title chosen by each is
precisely similar. Their taste appears to have been
formed from the same models, and directed to the
same ends3 and they both speak in the most rap-
turous terms of Poussin, Milton, and Kent. Ma-
son’s poem, l believe, preceded that of the Abbe‘
only about a twelvemonth ; but there is no reason to
conceive that the latter, though acquainted with the
English language, was by any means apprised of
such a publication, when he announced his own

Jartlins.

This elegant metaphor is frequently ern-
ployed by Lucretius, in the prosecution of his poem.
Ausonius has borrowed it from him. Mosel. 269.

reia diei.'’

Exultant udae super arida saxa rapinae,
Luam-ique pavent letalia tela diei.

O'ei· the sere rock the juicy rape exults,
And dreads the deadly arrows of the day.

b. vi. 1414.
111ae nec solis radios, nec tela diei
Lucida ferre queunt.

Not these the sun’s pure beams, nor javelins bright‚
Can bear of neon-tide.

Mason, who, as I have just remarked, is a close
and classieal imitator of our poet, has not failed to
employ this bold and beautiful figure, also, in his
English Garden.

 

Soon thy sturdy axe,

Amid its intertwisted foliage driven,

Shall open all his glades, and ingress give·

To the bright darts qs day. Β. ii. 151.

In Dr. Darwin‘s Loves of the Plants, we meet
with the same idea, which is introduced with much
beauty and sublimity. He is speaking of the hu-
mane Howard.

The spirits of the good, who bend from high,
Wide o'er these earthly scenes, their partial eye,
Saw round his brows a sun-like glory blaze,

In arrowy circles of unwearied rays.

The whole description forms a bold and elevated
imagery 3 for which, however, if Ι be not much mis-
taken, he is indebtcd to Ariosto. The passageI
