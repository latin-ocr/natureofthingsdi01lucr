for how can larks oppose
The vigorous swan ἒ they are unequal foes.

Admitting the seigned musical note of the swan,
the lark might still vie with him; but the broken
chirp of the swallow could have no such pretensions.
It was, moreover, a very general belief among the
multitude in Greece and Rome, that the swan, when
dying, sang more melodiously than any bird3 while
the har-sb and idle twittering of the swanow was held
in the utmost contempt. Thus, Anacreon, address-
ing himself to the latter, inquires,

Whilsz such, on the contrary, was the high esteem
entertained soi· the supposed music of the swan, that

the poets were, uniform1y‚ fond of arrogating this
appellation to themselves. Pindar, Virgil, and many
others, have been often thus denominated3 and it is

to the swan that Horace refers in the following
verses:

Jam jam residunt cruribus asperae
Pelles, et album rnu'tor in alitem
Super-ne, nascunturque laeves

Per digitos humerosque plumae.

Lm. II. od. 20.

Now, now harsh scales my legs invest;
A whiteuing bird, above, I grow:
O’er all my fingers, arms and erest,
I feel the downy plumage flow.

There is a passage iu the first book of Cicero's
Tusculan Q1estions, that forms so admirable a com-
ment upon this comparison of Lucretius, that I can-
not avoid translating it. ‘⁴ The chattering and im-
portunate swaiiow‚'' says he, “ is an emblem of the
ignorant: but the swan that never sing-s till he feels
the approach of death, seems to possess some pre-
sentiment that death is not without its blessing 3—

hence he becomes an emblem of the wise.”

The Abba Delil're, in his description of this mag-
nificent bird, has alluded to the same popular
tradition, in the following elegant verses :

Au milieu d‘eaux s'eleve, et nage avec fierte
Le cygne au cou superbe, au plumage ar-
gente ;
