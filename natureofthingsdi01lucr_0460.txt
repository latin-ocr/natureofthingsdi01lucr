a new organization, we trace the production of a new
power, that l mean of sensation. From sensation,
we afterwards discover the origin ofidcas and thought.
There is an admirable simplicity in the laws and ope-
ratione of nature. It is the grand characteristic of
creation: and we are sure to err in our reasoning,
when we pre-suppose a greater complexity in the
cause, than is necessary to produce a definite effect.
I do not here follow up the vague opinions of Dr.
Darwin, with respect to vegetable life, and vegetable
sensations3 because, if they be not founded upon
fancy alone, there is too little ground for admitting
them as philosophie truths. Those, however, who
are acquainted with his Botanic Garden and Temple
of Nature, but more especially with his Phytologia,
well know that he eontends, not only for the existence
of a corporeal structure in vegetables‚ consisting of ar-
teries,veins‚ lymphatics, museles, umbilical vessels‚sex-
ual and respiratory organs, but also for that of nerves,
and a common sensorium or brain ; and the senses of
love and hatred‚ pleasure, pain, and sleep. See chap-
ter viii. of this last entertaining publication. Yet, the
doctor himself has been in some degree exceeded by M.
Patrin‚ who equally eontends for a similar kind of sen-
sation‚ if not of structure, in the mineral world; and
coneeives‚ fron] their assimilations and elective at-
tractions, that minerals are as much organized in
their own way, as any vegetables whatever3 from the
stone which we call brute, because wc perceive not
the relations which connect it with the rock from
which it was separated, to the beautiful minet-al ve·
εςείαΙίοη denominatedstosfi'rri, which so much resem-
bles marine producfions, and appears to be one of the
intermediate links which nature has placed on the
confines of her different kingdoms, to connect them
with each other. See Nouveau Dietionnaire et Hist.
Naturclle appliquee aux Arts, tom. xiv.

From these observations it should seem then that
gravitation‚ ehemical affinities, irritability, sensation,
thought, all equally and progressively flow from
various nwdifications of matter, and from matter alone.
Nature indeed appears to show, and Lueretius, who

is the poet of nature, undertakes to affirm, that no
modifications of matter can continue for ever, and
consequently that at death the dissolution must be
entire ; and the thinking principle of man, the material
spirit which animates him, as necessarily perish as any
other part of his frame. But the glorious revelation
which ‘⁶ has brought [ψ and immortality,” the know—
ledge of the soal, and of afuture resurrection “ to light,’'
tcaches υς, in a voice ‘⁶ which cannot lie,” that matter
may and will continue for ever uneorrupted and in an
organized form ι it establishes the triumphant belief,
that the body at large shall hereafter arise from itt
grave, to the inheritance of eternal life ; and that that
part of it which constitutes the soul is immortal from
its very birth. For a continuation of this subject,
see note on Book ΙΙΙ. v. 100.
