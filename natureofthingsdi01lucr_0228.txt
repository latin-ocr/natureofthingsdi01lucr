DE RERUM NATURA.

L113. Ι.

Usque adeo largos haustus de fontibus amnis

Lingua meo suavis diti de pectore fundet,

Ut verear, ne tarda prius per membra senectus

415

Serpat‚ et in nobis vita'i claustra resolvat,

Quam tibi de qua vis una re versibus omnis

Argumentorum sit copia missa par aureis.

Sed nunc, ut repetam coeptum pertexere dictis.

Omnis, ut est, igitur, per se, natura duabus

420

Constitit in rebus: nam corpora sunt, et inane3

Haec in quo sita sunt, et qua divorsa moventur.

Corpus enim per se conmunis dedicat esse

Sensus: quoi nisi prima fides fundata valebit,

Haud erit, obcultis de rebus quo referentes

425

Confirmare animos quidquam ratione queamus·

Tum porro locus, ac spatium, quod inane vocamus,

Of svaei: ancl nomn] Thus Epicurus, in

*his Epistle to Herodotus3
πηέε never, “the whole is partly body, partly void-'⁷
This, of course, opens to us the tenet of the Epicu-
rean sect, as to the human soul. But as no such
doctrine is the immediate object of discussion before

us, and as its entire consideration is reserved for a
different part of the work, I forbear entering into
the controversy at present. The axiom Lucretius is
immediately endeavouring to demonstrate, 15, that every
fact, 01 matter, occurring in life, and which cannot
strictly be sesols-cd into either vacuum or body, is a
consequence or collateral attendant upon the one 01·
the other: it is either a comunem-ion or property

of matter, or an snm· or accident flowing from its
operations. This is more fully elucidated from verse
500 to 509, and developes another principle of the ·
Epicurean hypothesis. It is thus Diogenes Laertius
conveys to us the sentiments of the founder of the
sect: Παςα. δε ταυτα. (amp-0⁶71» nempe και κενον) ουΘεν
ουτε επιγοηθηναι δυναται, ουτε πεξιληπτως, ουτε αναλογως τοις
mecam-ross, ὦς καθ’ ολας φυσεις λαμςανομενα, και μη ως
τοι, τουτων συμπτωματοι η συμςεέηκοτα, λεγομενα. “ It is
impossible for the mind to understand, or even con-
ceive of any thing besides body and vacuum; or
even any thing resembling them, possessed ofa dis-
tinct aud appropriate nature, and which will not rank,

as an accident or event, under these denominations.''
