been often opposed in every age; yet, upon the

whole, it has ever been t'ne most popular of any
among men of letters, till about the middle of the

last century, or rather later3 since which time, che-
mistry has been gradually assuming a scientific form,
and with a dai-ing, but steady eye, and an unsuspected
success, has probed into the origin, not only of na-
tural phaenomena, but of nature herself. And what
after all, is the result? Is the world produced from
different elements or principles, or from one and the
same infinite mass of indivisible, indestructible‚ and
homogeneous atonis ἓ From the system of Epicurus,
corroborated by the weighty assent of Sir Isaac
Newton, or from some one of the various opinions of
other philosopher-s, who have radiated from this point
in almost every possible direction ?

To begin with the element of fire, calorie, or latent
heat. Wcre this a substance distinct from the par-

ticles of a heated body; a something superadded to
it, and nota mere rte-arrangement and new modification

of those particles ; the greater the degree of heat, the
greater we should necessarily expect to find the gra-
vity ofsuch body ; and both Margraff and Lewis have
brought forwards a few experiments ostensibly favour-
able to such afact. These‚however,are easily accounted
for, upon the principle of calcination‚ and the ab·
sorption of carbonic aeid gas ; while others, of greater
aeeuracy and precision‚ have concurred in determining
either that there is no difference between the weight
of a body heated to redness, and what it possessed
when cold, or that the body in a cold temperature
exhibits rather a greater degree of gravity than when
red·hot.—For further information on this subject, I
refer the readex to the experiments of Mr. White-
burst and Dr. Roebuck, as stated in the Philosophi-
cal Transacfions, Vol. LXVI, part ii. What then
must necessarily be the result of such experiments
and observations, but that, according to the opinion
of our sagacioris and philosophie poet, fire is not a
primary material substance, but a mere motion, or
new and peculial· arrangement of primary particles

themselves ?

Yet other elements have been canvassed as scrupu-
lously as fire, and the same doctrine applies to each
of them. Barth, it appearS, is the productiori of
water, and water of air : while air is, unques-
tionably‚ a compound‚ and perhaps a compound
of compounds; for we know not, nor have any reason
to believe that the gasses which form it, are any of
them simple and unigenous ς a few facts will be suffi-
cient to illustrate this opinion.—·It has long been
suspected by philosophers, that there is not at pre-
sent so much water in the world as there was for-
merly ; while the quantity of earth, and consequently
of continents and islands‚ has been increasing in an
inverse ratio: it has hence been conceived, that wa·
ter is continually converting into earth3 and some
experiments have very considerably favoured such an
hypothesis. There is no water so pure and uncom-
pounded, that it will not, if kept for three or four
yearS‚ make an earthy deposit: rain water, distilled
water, and snOW‚ have all been tried for this purposeg
but the same deposit, or transmutation into earth,
has uniformly taken place. This phenomenon was
long ago observed by Boerhaave, who declared, in
consequence hereof‚ that there was no such thing as
pure water to be obtained any where, or by any
means-The seeds of plants likewise‚ as the white-
mustard seed, and some aquatic animals, as leeches,
are known to increase in solid substance by the sus-
tenance of water alone 3 or, at least, without the in-
termixture of earth, properly so called. Barth, then,
is the productiori of water, and not an original ele-
ment ; and hence we reduce the four elements, com-
monly so called, to two alone ς to wit, water and air.

There are few persons of a liberal education, but
are acquainted with some of the experiments upon
water, of Mr. Cavendish‚ and the late M. Lavoisier.
From these experiments, it should seem that water is
no more a radical substance than earth; or, at least,
that it is producible from a due intermixture of in-
flammable and dephlogistieated airs; or, according
to the new, and more accurate nomenclature‚ of
