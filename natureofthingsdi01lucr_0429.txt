Each self dependent, and from human wants

THE NATURE OF THINGS.

Estrang’d for ever. ,There no pain pervadeS‚

Nor dangers threaten ; every passion sleep5‚

Vice no revenge‚ and virtue draws no boon.

Meantime the earth sensation never knows ;

But, blest with the rude principles of thingS,

In various mode hence various forms she rears.
Call, if thou chuse it, the resounding deep

NEPTUNE‚ and CERES term the golden grain ;

Securus ades? non solicitus
Prodesse bonis, nocuisse malis.

whence springs it then, that thou, whose power
Sways every scene through every hour,

The radiant orbs, through ether hurl’d,

The balance of the buoyant world,

should’st look with unconcern below

On human weal and human woe,

Unanxious to reward the just,

Or tread th’ unrighteous to the dust-

Vida had, probably, our poet in his memory‚ when he

wrote the following t

Et Cererem frumenta

 

Pom-ic iii. 123.
They now name Ceres sor the golden grain,

Bacchus for wine, and Neptune for the main.

It is not often the philosophers of a nation, but
the people themselves, who thus multiply gods, and
truce, in every attribute or operation osone Supreme
Creator, a distinct and adorable existence. Hesiod
enumerates thirty thousand deities, acknowledged
und worshipped in his own day ; and Bruxiuus, long
afterwards, indeed, deelared in the Roman Servate,

Vnt. I.

that the divinities avowed by the state amounted to
at least two hundred and eighty thousand. But
the enlightened philosopher, whether among the
Greeks or the Romans, who admitted a supreme in-
telligence of any kind, seldorn divided the godhead,
and contemplated this confused assemblage of popu·
lar divinities as nothing more than mere images of his
different attributes and operations. In this belief the
more intelligent of the poets themselves united 3 and
most of them could associate with AEschylus‚ in the
assertion : Ζευς εστιν αιθηρ, Ζευς τε γη, Ζευς δε ουραγος,
Ζευς τοι aromo-oe. Strom. v. “Jupiter is the air, Ju-
piter is the earth, Jupiter is the heaven, all is Ju-
p'ter :’' or, as Alexander the Epicurean expresses it ε
“ the supreme power is sometimes denominated Ju-
piter, sometimes Apollo, sometimes Pallas.'' Huric
deum appellavit aliqnando Jovem‚ aliquando Apol-
linem, et aliquando Palladem. Albert. Magn. Phys.

So Virgil :
Ab Jove principium, Musae ι Jovis omnia plena.
All springs from Jove, and all os Jove is full.-
ECL. iii. 60.
It is the same among the Asiatics. The un.
lettered Hindu, Lke the unlettertd citizen of ancient
Rome, pays his homage to deities without number;
bnt the learned regards the etex-nal Brema as one and

the same power under all this endless divarication,
