ΤΗΕ NATURE OF THINGS.

Here HoMER's spectre roam'd, of endless fame

Possest: his briny tears the bard survey⁷d,

140

And drank the dulcet precepts from his lips

Such are the various creeds of men.

And hence

The philosophie sage is call'd t' explain,

Not the mere phases of the heavens alone,

The sun’s bright path, the moon’s perpetual change,

145

And pow’rs of earth productive, but to point,

In terms appropriate, the dissev’ring lines

’Twixt mind and brutal life3 and prove precise

VVhence spring those shadowy forms, which, e'en in hours

Wakeful and calm, but chief when dreams molest,

'Twas midnight deep ; the world was hush'd to rest,
And airy visions every brain possess⁷d ε

O'er all my frame a horror crept severe,

An ice that shiver'd every bone with fear3

Before my face a spirit saw I swim—

Erect uprose my hair o'er every limb:

It stood-the spectre stood—to sight display'd ;
Yet trac’d I not the image Ι survey’d.

'Twas silence dead—no breath the torpor broke,
When thus, in hollow voice, the vision spoke.

No criticism is here necessary. Every one who
reads the description must perceive, in every line,
some peculiar and appropriate beauty. But the im-

the apparition, even whilst it stood motionless before
the narrator, and compelled his attention, together
with the erectiori of the hair of the whole body, con-
vey a boldness and originality of thought superlatively
impressive. From this fearful picture, Ariosto,
Spenser, and Otway‚ have drawn many of their best
and finest paintings. They have allvof them, like·
wise, made choice of solitude and the midnight sea-
son for the inti-oduction of their supernatural imagery.
But there are some occasions in which a masterly
poet, regardless of the trammels of example, may be

justified in introducing such scencry at any bour, and

even in the presence of the most brilliant or convivial
companies. Thus, in the tragedy of Macheth, the
ghost of Banquo suddenly arises in the midst of the
entertainment given to the noble thanes ; aud which,
though by Shakspeare denominated a supper, would,
in the present day, be regarded as an early dinner,
since-seven is the hour at which the lords were in-
vited to assemble. The incident is too well known,
and its effect too striking, to need any comment.
There is one description of a similar incident, how-

possibility of tracing or distinguishing the form of ever, by which even this of Shakspeare is much ex-
