consequence from the first principles of Democritus
and Epicurus, an‘d allthose who, denyingtheimmediate
superintendence of aDivinity in the formation of the
world, traced the production of all things, animals as
well as vegetableS‚ from certain apparently anoma-
lous organizations of matter alone. The popular
creed and the mythology of the poets coincided
in the same hypothesis. When ovid, therefore, who
has copied from Hefiod his account of the antediluvian
ages of the world, relates at length the destruction of
every species osanimals by the deluge, with the single
exception of Deucalion and Pyrrha; he supposes the
whole human racc regenerated ; and this, in obedience
to the command of the oracle consulted on the oc-
casion, not from coition of the surviving pair, but
from casting the stones of the earth backwards over
their shoulders, which suddenly sostened and became
possest ofhuman features ε for, observes he,

Magna parens terra est : lapides in corpore terrae
Ossa reor diei. Mamm. l. i.

Our mighty mother is the earth ; the stones
Upon her surface doubtless are her bones.

In this fact, however, we trace at least the co-ope-
ration of man and woman, in the re—production of the
human race. But nothing· of the kind occurred, ac-
cording to the same tradition, in the renewal of every
other species of animals. For the poet shortly pro,

ceeds to infmm us that,

Caetera diversis tellus animalia formis
Sponte sua peperit, postquam vetus humor ab
igne ’

Pei-caluit solis; coexmmque, udaeque paludes

Intumuere aestu ; faecundaque semina rerum

Vivaci nutrita solo, ceu matris in alvo, ·

Creverunt‚ faciemque aliquam cepere morando.

for this power of spontaneous generation ; and having

throughout every European state, after the dissemi-
natio-‚1 of the Christian religion, than any ‘other phi-
losopher, this doctrine iil-:ewice deseended with his
general code of tenets, till about a century ago the
whole fabric sustained 3 severe assault from the united
labours of Des Cartes, anle, Malbranchc, and
Newtom who maintained, that all animal life must ne-
cessarily be propagated by sexual corr-merce alone;
and be continued either viviparously or oviparously.

But by experinients aud observations which have
since been made, and that with the most undeviating
attention, it should seem that these are not the only
means by which animal life is generated : that sexual
commerce is by rio means absolutely necessary in every
instance, and that succeeditig ‘races are propagated
in modes altogether as numerous and as diverse as in
the vegetable world. The resemblance in this respect,
between the two depaitments, is indeed most striking
and astonishing3 and it is equally certain in bothcases,
that although sexual intercourse, and oviparous and
viviparous gestation, the medium Ι mean of seeds and
bulbs or buds in the vegetable kingdom, and eggs
and living fetuses in the animal, are generally em-
ployed by nature for this purpose, yet in each de-
partment there are also other modes of propagatim,
by no means unfrequently adopted. The armed
polypus or hydra of Linneus multiplies its species,

¹ like the water-lentii, by sending offlateral shoots from

the body of the parent reptile. The bell-polypus or
hydra stentora inci-cases by splitting longitudinassy ς
and these divisions, and every succecding race of di.
visons, continue to re-split every twenty-four hours,
till the original stock in 3 few days produces an in-
numerable offspring.
