Se fingit, sensuque suo contaminat adstans.

Hinc indignatur se mortalem esse creatum3

Nec videt, in vera nullum fore morte alium se,

Qui possit vivus sibi se lugere peremptum,

Stansque jacentem se lacerari, urive, dolere.

Nam, si in morte malum est,

malis morsuque ferarum

Tractari; non invenio, qui non sit acerbum,

Ignibus inpositum, calidis torrescere fiammi33

Aut in melle situm subfoeari, atque rigere

Frigore, quom summo gelidi cubat aequore saxi ;

Ipse sui miseret ; neque enim se dividit ipsum,
Nec removet, satis a projecto corpore ; at illum

Se fingit.

 

The meaning of our poet, however, is obvious, and
the translators do not differ greatly in their interpreta-
tions. The man, who tremblcs at the thought that his
body may be hereaftcr exposed to the ravages of birds
or beasts‚ or to any other similar destruction of its
component parts, does not divide or distinguish be-
tween the dead and the living machine; but secretly
apprehends, that the sam: consciousncss and percep-
tion must appertain to each of them. Socrates, in
his conversation with Crito, after having drank the
fatal cup, is well known to have made a similar ob-
servation : ‘⁴ I can never‚” said he, “ persuade Crito,
that that alone is Socrates, which has the power of
arranging his arguments, and of conversing with
you 3 for lie perpetually conceive& that what he
will presently behold dead is myself. He confounds
Plut. in Phaed.

ludes to the different modes *of sepulture adopted by
ancient nations. The poorer classes were interred in
public cemeteries beyond the walls, or immediate
boundary of the town in which they died, in a sunk,
unnoticeable grave, without the more modern ap-
pendage of hillocks or romb-stones. Of the richer
classes, the bodies of great numbers were burnt to ashes
on a magnificent pyre, and the ashes carefully collect-
ed, and deposited in an ornamented urn3 while others
were embalmed after the Egyptian manner, with an
anti-putrescent preparation composed of honey and
spices, and then removed to some stone or marble
tomb provided for the express purpose. Heraclides
of Pontus advised the former mode of sepulture 3 De-
mocritus, the latter: Lucretius attacks them both
with much severity for expressing any anxiety upon

the subject.

That honey was the principal ingredient in the
preparation of the embalmen we learn from the fol-
lowing statement of Xenophon, which relates to the

body of Agesipolis king of Sparta, lib. v. 3, 19,
Helen. Kou
