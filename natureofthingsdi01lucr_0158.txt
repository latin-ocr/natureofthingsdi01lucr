DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. Ι.

Submittit flores; tibi rident aequora ponti,

Placatumque nitet diffuso lumine coelum.

Nam, simul ac species patefacta est verna diei,

10

Et reserata viget genitabilis aura Favonii ;

begin-t, like winter, with storms, and clouds, and
terrible darkness. Havin g delivered his dreadful man-
date to the affrighted troops, he dissolves again
into air, and vanishes from sight. Then, observes
Ercilla,

Al punto los confusos elementos

Fueron sus movimientos aplacandO,

Y los desenfrenados quatro vientos,

Se van a sus cavernas retirando.

Las nuves se retraen Ξι sus assientos

El cielo y claro sol desocupando.

Quick as he vanish’d, nature's struggles cease 3
The troubled elements are sooth'd to peace.
The winds no longer ruge with boundless ire,
But, hush’d in silence, to their caves retire ς
T he clouds disperse, restoring, as they fly,
The unobstructed sun, and azure sky.
Hauer-
A more general imitation still is to be met with in
the Fasti of ovid, as was long ago observed by
Bentley, from whose notes Mr. Wakefield has intro-
duced it into his own correct and elegant edition:

Illa quidem totum dignissima temperat orbem,
Illa tenet nullo regna minora deo:
Juraque dat coelo, terrae, natalibus undis ,-
Perque suos initus continet omne genus.
Illa deos omnes (longum enumerare) creavit ·‚
Illa satis caussas, arboribusque dedit:
Illa rudes animos hominum contraxit in unum,
Et docuit jungi cum pare quemque sua.
Quid genus omne creat volui-rum, nisi blanda voluptas,
Ne: co'e'ant pecudes, si levis absit Amor?
Fas-r. iv. 9¹·
Sublime, she modulates th' attemper'd world,
Nor aught of godhead boasts an ampler sway ;
Heaven, earth, and peopled main, her rites profem,
And in her fond embrace all nature lives.
She form’d the gods, in all their number form'd,

And times and tides to hei-bs and harvests gives.
Rude savage man forth from the wilds she led,
And bound with social and domestic ties.

What rears the feathery tribes but genial love?
But love, what stings the flocks with fierce desire?

To notice, however, all the copies which have ori-gi-
nated from this beautiful address, would be endless. ’
Ι will only add the following of Dr. Darwin, both
because he admits it to be a copy, in a subjoined note,
and because he has copied with spirit. He is describ-
ing the approach of Eros or Cupid instead of Venus :
the son instead of the mother:

Earth‚ at his feet, extends her flowery bed,

And bends her silver blossoms round his head ς

Dark clouds dissolve, the warring winds subside‚

And smiling ocean calms his tossing tide.

O’er the bright noon meridian lustres play,

And heaven salutes him with a flood of day.
Teium.. OF Nar.

Ver. 8. Pours forth lm· sweetest flow'rets; Ocean
laughs] Between the two imagcs described in
this verse, Creech, in his translation, has introduced
four or five lines, which have no prototype in any
copy of the original, at least in any I have ever seen t.

The earth with various art (for thy warm pow’rs
The dull mass feels) puts forth her gaudy flowers :
[For thee doth subtle luxury prepare

The choicest stores of earth, and sea, and air ;
To welcotne thee she comes prosusely drest

Vv'ith all the spices of the wanton East :

To pleasure thee e'en lazy luxury toils ε]

The roughest sea puts on smooth looks and smiles.

His annotator on these verses informs us that the
supplemental lines are an improvement of the transla=
tor upon his author. That they are an addition
must be confest: the improvement is not quite so
obvious.
