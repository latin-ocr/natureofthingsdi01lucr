DE RERUM NATURA.

Lan. Ι.

Sed, quae sunt rerum primordia, nulla potest vis

Stringuere3 nam solido vincunt ea corpore demum3

Et si difficile esse videtur cred-ere quidquam

In rebus solido reperiri corpore posse:

Transit. enim fulmen coeli per saepta domorum,

Dissiliuntque fere ferventi saxa vapore:

1 have often been amused at the disputes in
which men of extensive learning and profound spe-
culation have engaged on the subject of matter ; but
more especially at beholding them, in the prosecu-
tion of their inquiries, arrive at a conclusion the
very converse of that for which they at first con-
tended. Dr. Priestley was denominated a materialist,
and he thus acknowledged himself3 and, in effect,
fought more battles under the standard of material-
ism than any other champion in Christendom. Every
thing with him was matter in the Universe that was

' not space ε there was no tertium quid, or third and

different substance : consequently, the soul of man is
material. But what is matter, or rather what is its
definition? If Ι recollect might, these are the Doc-
tor’s words: “ Matter is a solid and extended sub-
stance, endowed with powers of attraction and repul·-
sion.”—With this definition, he enters into a contro-
versy with his friend Dr. Price3 and, nugatory as
was its termination‚ the world is much indebted to
these celebrated men for the controversy thus com-
menced. Can matter think? is the grand question
proposed by the latter; a substance naturally inert,
and which is only moved by collision or other vio-
lence? Mamer, observes Dr. Priesssey, in his reply
to this question, may think, for matter is not inert3
it is not impenetrable: it is not, logically speaking,
nolid. No bodies, at any time, come into immediate
contact with each other, or influence each other by
means of simple solidity. The earth is affected by
the sun 3 the moon by the earth ⁵> the waters of the

earth by the moon. Light is reflected from substances
to which it directs its course, at a distance, and
without impinging upon them. The particles of all
bodies deerned the most solid and impermeable are, at
any time, made to approach nearer, or recede farther
from each other, by the application of different degrees
of heat or cold. We can form no conception, there-
fore, of the beginning of perfect solidity; and it is
not an improbable conjecture, that all the elementary
matter employed in the formation of the solar system,
might be ‘comprized in the capacity of ει· nut-shell.
It is, indeed, most probable, that there is no such
thing as solidity in nature; and that matter, consist-
ently with the theory of Boscovich‚ is nothing more
than a compages oft-enters ο] various attractions and
repulsiotis extending indefinitely in all possible direc-
tions.—Hence then it was replied‚ the only powers
or properties of matter are atti-action and repulsiona
But powers must be the powers of something: yet if
matter have nothing but these powers, and be nothing
but these powe1·s,—then is it a non-entity, or rather be-
comes altogether immateriaI.—Towards the termina·-
tion, therefore,of this literary contest, it seems to have
been agreed, that materialism and immaterialism were
the same thing: and on the part of Dr. Priestley,
that, provided there were but one substance admitted
in the formation of man, and the creation of the Uni-
verse, he was totally unconcernedv about the term;
and was equally ready to denominate it· a material,
or an immaterial substance.
