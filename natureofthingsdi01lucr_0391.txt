’Twere vain t’ attempt: for all the soul that wakes

To various pleasure, boasts a base rotund3

While pain but springs from atoms hook'd and harsh.

Yet seeds there are between3 not smooth complete,

Nor deeply jagged, but with angles shap’d

Just peeping o’er the surface.

These the nerves

Pain not, but titillate3 a sense perceiv’d

When sweets with bitters, sours with sweets combine,

As oft in sauces, cater'd to the taste

From the pale inula, or grape's soft grounds.

The taste of the sauce alluded to in this passage,
and obtained from the lees of the Coun, or Falernian
wine, was acid3 while that produced from the inula
was a pleasant and modified buter, or austere. For
though Horace, in another passage, Sat. ii. 2. ap-
plies the epithet aeid to this latter (acidas mavult
inulam—he only means to express its general acri-
mony or pungency. And in his eighth epistle of the
same book, he has allotted to it its proper appella-

kinds, which, like the former, rendered it not only a
catice grateful to the miste, but wholesome to the sto-

mach. Thus Pliny: Amarior inula per se stomacho ini-
micissima, eadem dulcibus mistis saluberrima. Pluribus
modis austeritate victa gratiam invenit. L. xix. c. 5.

the corporiety of cold, however, became doubted about
a century ago, and was, at length, universally denied;
Boerhaave, I believe, being the last who contended
forits substantial nature, in opposition to the doctrine,
that it was nothing more than a mere negative qua-
lity. Yet. since it frequently occurs in the great
cycle of the sciences, as in the operations of nature,
that that which dies in one season revives in another,
so the new tenet, that cold is a mere negative quality.
