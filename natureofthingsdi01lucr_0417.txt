THE NATURE OF THINGS.

The wildest young a mother's cares may tame ;

And, with a mural crown her brows they bound,

Since with her tow’rs she guards man’s civic rights.

Thus deckt, tremendous, round fr‘om realm to malm,

Still moves the solemn pomp, by all ador'd.

early period of the world, we may fairly conclude from
an admission of the Egyptians themselves, that this
country was inhabited antecedently to their own.
The first occupiers were therefore probably a colony
of Cuthites or Ammonians, a branch of the confe-
derate idolaters, who were scattered in every direction
from the plains of Shinar. during the ereffion of the
city of Babel. In consequence of this early popula-
tion‚ Phrygia became soon and extensively celebrated

former she is said to have derived from the Egyp-
tians, having been taught them by Hercules, who was
avowedly of Egyptian descent; and respecting her
knowledge of the latter, we may form some idea from

for her progress in letters and agriculture.

the Romans having borrowed the radical of her own
name, as a general appellation for grain among them-
selves ε for there can be little doubt that the Latin
term smges was derived from the Greek Φρυγια. (Phry.
gia), on the introduction of letters into Greece.
See however more particularly the note on Book V·

Upon this subject Faber has offered us a conjecture

in some degree different, and I believe less tenable.
Yet, though fancfful, it is ingenious. The term

Idae (13:4⁵), observes he,in its original signification, im-

plies mountainous and woody places, aenis well known

to those who are acquainted with the Greek his-
torians and etymologists3 whence he infers, that as
these were the original dwellings of rude uncivilized
man, the term Idaea Mater is expressive of that earliest
infancy of the human racc, in which they were sup-
ported by acornS, or other natural and uncultivated
productions3 or pursued the savage life of the hunter.
But, continues Faber, after the invention of agricul-
ture, she was denominated Phrygia, from the term
φρυγειν, “to dry or dress in the sun.'’ thce, even
upon this etymology, we may obser-ve that the Ro·
mans denominated grain of every kind by the generic
term fimges .· as also the propriety of assigning to
the Dea-Mater a body of attendants of Phrygian
descent :

The field was cultur’d‚ and the harvest rose.

Were this criticism of Faber strictly correct, it
would give us, in the name of the goddess, in her
attendants, and in the ornament of her head-dress,
an appropriate allusion to the three successive states
in which the greater part of mankind have probably
existed ; Ist, In the unsettled character of hunters or
shepherds‚ wandering from mountain to mountain,
and supporting tlitmselves with the uncultivated pro-
ductions of nature, the milk of their flocks, or the
casual success of their adventures in the woods.
