popularity. We are told by Seneca, that not the learned alone, but
even the unlettered, reverenced the name of Epicurus3 and Lactantius
assei-ts, that no other sect was, at this time, by any means so flourish-
ing. It is to the credit of this sect, moreover, that, notwithstanding
its great numbers, it never subdivided into partics; and that the opi-
nions of its institutor were voluntarily submittcd to with more implicit
confidence, than PythagoraS, even by an express law, could ever ex-
act from his γνησιω ὁμιλετοιι, or most attached and genuine disciples.

It was in consequence of this perfect deference to the doctrines os
Epicurus, and the uninterrupted union of his followers, that the school
continued to flourish under the Roman emperorS, for a long course of
years, as Laertius asserts, after other schools had begun to decay⁴
The most celebrated adherents to this system, from the death of Lu-
cretius to the establishrnent of the Christian religion, were Pliny the
elder, Celsus, Luciam, and Diogenes Laertius. Of these, the first, to
whom we are indebted for his “ Natural History of the W'orld,” does
not, however, appear to have imbibed the whole of the Epicurean
theory, and especially the tenet of a multiplicity of habitable worldso

Celsus is far better known as an Epicurean philosopher, in consequence
of the controversy between himself and Origen. His works are totally

lost, except detached passages cited by Origen in his reply, It js ge,
nerally conjectured, that he flourished under Adrian and Aurelius An-
toninus. Origen, however, mentions two philosophers of this name,
both Epicureans; the former of whom, he tells us, existed in the
reign of Nero, while the latter was born in that of Adrian, whom he

survived ³4. ’
