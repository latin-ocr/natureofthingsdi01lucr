lxviii THE LIFE OF LUCRETIUS.

rccommendiug the same. With respect to the popular religion, he as-
serts:

No—it can ne’er be piety, to turn

To stocks and stones with deep-veil’d visage3 light
O'er every altar incense 3 o’er the dust

Fau prostrate, and with outstretch’d arms invoke
T hrough every temple every god that reigns 3
Soothe them with blood, and lavish vows on vows.
This rather thou term piety, to mark

With calm untrembling soul each scene ordain'd ¹³.

without this calmness of the soul, this sacred freedom from every
gross and ungovernable passion, it is in vain, he assei-ts, in another
place, to expect any benefit from these hallowed and religious seelu-
sions‚ this spiritual quietism and devotion offered up, not at the shrines
of the fabulous gods of the people‚ but in the great templo of ‘⁶ the
immense concave of lieaven,’' the pure abode of superior intelligence3,
who are well entitled to the appellation of divinities—being, them-
selves, the fairest resemblance of the supreme Creator. On this sub-

lime subject, he thus expresses himself:

For O γε POWERS vamE l whose tranquil lives

Flow free from care, with ceaseless sun-shine mest,—
Who the vast whole could guide‚ midst all your ranks ?
Who grasp the reins that curb th’ ENTIRE OF THINGS,
Turn the broad heavens, and pour through countless worlds
Th' ethereal fire that feeds their vital throngs—

Felt every moment, felt in every place ?

Who form the louring clouds, the lightning dart,

And roll the clamorous thunder, oft in twain

‘Rending the concave ? or, full-deep retir'd‚

who point in secret the mysterious shaft

T hat, whilst the guilty triumphs, prostrates stern

The fairest forms of innocence and worth †? '
