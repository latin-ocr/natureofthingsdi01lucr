be decompounded 3 it will return to its original, its elementary atonis:
and new worlds will arise from its destruction.

Space is infinite, material atonis are infinite, but the world is not
infinite—This, then, is not, the only world, or the only material system
that exists. The cause whence this visible system originated is com-
petent to produce others; it has been acting perpetually from all eter-

but from the uninterrupted beatitude and tranquillity they enjoy, their
everlasting freedom from all anxiety and care.

Such is the‘ system of Epicurus, reduced to a brief outline; and

sketch, a striking resemblance to a great variety of the most important
and best established doctrines of the present day. These I pretend

our pursuit. To the ensuing pages I therefore refer my readers for
additional information; and am much mistaken if, on closing the vo-
lumes, they will not coincide with Lambinus in admitting that the phi-2
