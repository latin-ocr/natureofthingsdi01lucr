Partibus amissis quoniam libata recessit.

Et nullas parteis in corpore liquerit ex se;

Unde cadavera rancenti jam viscere vermeis

Exspirant ? atque unde animantum copia tanta,

of his past sclf remaining in his present. To con-

ceive then that, amidst this general waste and repair,
there are some few atoms so specially endowed as
to resist every change whatsoever, and competent to
retain their posts unshakcn and unaffefted by all
that occurs on every side ς and more especially, to con-
ceive that, after death, they shall remain connected,
while all is dispersed around them, is to indulge a la-
titude of fancy, highly incongruous with the rigid
rnles of philosophizing, and altogether unwarranted
by facts, or analogy. Nor does the conception re-
move any difficulty whatever. For, even admitting
that there are such atoms provided by nature, atoms
that change not during life, and that sleep unaltered
in the grave, the personal identity that hence en-
sues can only be partial; and the great mass of
extrinsic atonis which must unite to complete the re-
surging body, can still have no physical connexion
with the moral conduct of which these original
atoms partook in their anterior state of existence,
and, consequently, can possess no physical accounta-
bility whatsoever 3 nor be entitled to the common pu-
nishment or reward which the re—organized substance
is about to receive. The same difficulty, however,
attaches to immaterialists as well, and in nearly an

equal degree. For, admitting the essence of the
seul, or thinking principle, to be precisely the same
at the day of resurrection as it existed on earth, and
that personal identity and accountability are hence
preserved entire ς yet, upon its junction with a cor-
poreal body, if the entire particles of this body be
not precisely the same as those which constituted the
material machine at the hourJof death,—it can still be
but entitled in part, and not universally, to the retri-
bution that awaits it3 sor, whatever portions of it
are neW, and for the first time admitted into the ge-
neral organization, must be totally devoid of all prior
merit or demerit.

Personal identity and responsibility must, there-
fore, result from another cause3 from the simple
possession of consciousness, a property which may
be communicated by the Deity to any system of
matter he pleases. And as it would never be ad-
mitted vas a plea in diminution of guilt at the bar of
human justice, that the crime, of which the prisoner
stands charged, was committed ten or fifteen
years ago; and that hence, in consequence of the
physical changes which have taken place in his sys-
tem, heis not the idcntical culprit that committed
the crime alleged and proved against him ς so, neither
