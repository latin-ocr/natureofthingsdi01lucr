xxx THE LIFE OF LUCRETIUS.

tion: here the porch of Zeno, still erect and stately as its founder:
and here, the learned shades antl winding walks, in which
Epicurus had delineated the origin and NA'runr„ OF TirINGs, and
inculcatod tranquillity and temperance: and here too was the vast and
magnificent library that Pisistratus first established, and endowed for
the ¹gratuitous use of his countrymcn. Here Homer sung, and Apelles
painted : here Sophocles had drawn tears of tenderness‚ and Demost-
henes fired tho soul to deeds of heroism and patriotic revenge. Tho
monuments of every thing great or glorious, dignificd or refined, vir-
tuous or worthy, were still existing at Athens: and she had still
philosophers to boast of, who were capable of elucidating the erudi-
tion that blazed forth inore conspicuously in her earlier ages of inde-

pendence.

To this celebrated city, therefore, this theatre of universal learning,
Lucretius, with a great number of Roman youths of his own age, was
sent for education. Tho system of philosophy determinet] upon for
his pursuit‚ was that of Epicurus : and the Epicurean school, an edi-
fice erected and endowed by this profound and indefatigable sage him-
selfss, was, at the present period, suporintended by Phaedrus and
Zeno. Till this aera, however, the school of Epicurus had been gra-
dually deelining; and, unsupported by public patronage‚ the neat, but
modest mansion which had not been sufficiently provided for by its

*¹ The estate consisted ofa convenient house and most pleasant garden, in the walks and shades of
which Epicurus delivered his instructions to crowded and delighted audient-es ε the institution was hence
denominated ‘⁴ The School of the Garden‚” as that of Plato was the Acaderny, that of Aristode the
Lyceum, that of Zeno the Porch, and that of Antisthenes the Cynosargum. The purchase-money paid
for it was eighty minae, which, as the mina may be computed at about five pounds sterling iu the present
day, makes its sterling value about four hundred poundS. Epicurus entrusted it by his will, which has been
preserved by Diogenes Laertius, and is a curious and valuable document, to Hermaehus of Mitylene, a
beloved and confidential disciple, whom he hert-by nominated his successor, and expressly charged with the
execution of his different bequests. He provided for its perpetuity, upon the death of Hermachus, and
left it enriched with an extensive library, and endowed with a moderate revenue from another estate he
possessed at Mitylene : the house upon which he gave also to Hermaehus as his place of residence.
