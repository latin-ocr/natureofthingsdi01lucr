Boon I. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 73

With forms corporeal, nor consent to yield3
While the great progress of creation ceas’d.
But what more clear in earth or heav'n sublime, 38 5«
Or the vast ocean, than, in various modes,
That various matter moves? which, but for SPACE,
’Twere vain t’ expect: and vainer yet to look
For procreative power, educing still
Kinds from their kinds through all revolving time. 390
True, things are solid decm'd: but know that those
Dcem’d so the most are rare and unconjoin’d.
From rocks, and caves, translucent lymph distils,
And, from the tough bark, drops the healing balm.
The genial meal, with mystic power, pervades 395
Each avenue of life3 and the grove swells,
And yiclds its various fruit, sustain’d alone
From the pure food propell'd thro' root and branch.
Sound pierccs marble3 through reclusest walls
The bosom-tale transmits: and the kcen frost 400
E'en to the marrow winds its sinuous way.—
Dcstroy all vacuum, then, close ev'ry porc,
And, if thou carust, for such events account. ’
Say, why of equal bulk, in equal scale,
Arc things oft found uncqual in their poisc ἓ 405
O’er the light wool the grosscr lead prevails

W‘ith giant force. But wcre th' amount alike
