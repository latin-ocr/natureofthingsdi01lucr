THE NATURE OF THINGS. 433

Each member, must be stimulated first

Ere the keen atoms of the soul‚ hence rous'd‚

Engender sense, through every sev'ring space 405

Blending‚ rebounding, and reblending still.

But ’tis the mind guards chief the gates of life,

And than the soul with ampler vigour sways.

For, without mind or spirit, soul itself

In no one portion through the man can live 410

E’en for a moment: as companion fond

With speed it follows, dissipated wide,

And leaves the limbs beneath the ice of death ε

Spoil‘d of his noae, and shorten’d of his ears.
