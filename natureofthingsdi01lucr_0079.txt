ΤΙΙΕ LIFE OF LUCRETIUS. lxv

into a mere display of subtle and logomachic disputation. The sim-
plicity adopted by Epicurus in the selection of terms, and his cantion
in the assumption of principles, were an indirect attaek, as wellas a
severe reproof, upon this idle and growing fashion. The Aeadcmies
were sensible of it from their diminished numbers, and almost empty
walls : and they readily conspired, with the Stoics, in their unworthy at-
tempt to overthrow so formidable a battery. The animosity which

was thus early excited, continued to operate almost as long as Stoicism
and Platonism continued to exist3 and the disingenuous plan pursued

by their first votaries at Athens was, as I have already observed, too

generally had recourse to at Rome even by Cicero and Seneca theni-

selres.

But the Epicureans, it may he said, were atheists: they denied
the existence of a (jod, and ot' a future state: and some parts of
the poem of Lueretius arc expressly written to establish such de-

„iah-*Lot us examine these assertions separately.

If, in the first place, it he atheisni to deny the existence of those
absurd and viciens deitieS, who were the sele objects of adoration with
the multitude, the Epicureans were certainly guilty of atheism3 for
such they did deny. But it is so far from being proveable that they
uniformly disbeliered the existence ofan eternal First Cause ofall things;
that it is, perhaps, impossible to produce an Epicurean philosopher of
any age against whom such a charge can hc legitimately substantiated.
The philosophers of this school, on the contrary, have, at all times, as
openly avowed the existence of such a deity, and, in many imtances,
as strenuously contended for the truth of such an avowal, as the dis-

ciples of any system whatsoever. Such, in the seventeenth century,
were Gassendi, and Cudwmth, whose physics are altogether founded

upon the atomie hypothesis3 such was Abelard in the twelfth, Alex-
ander, who was a contemporary with Plutarch, in the first century, and
Veri. I. i
