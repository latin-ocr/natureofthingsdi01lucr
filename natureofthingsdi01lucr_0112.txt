xcviii THE LIFE OF LUCRETIUS.

He was, at this time, about forty-sour years of age: the date of the
city being probably 709, and his poem, though completed, had not

j'ect of this memoir, he must have been, at least four years older at the time of his decease, than Eusebius
has allowed ; sor the flight of Pompey and the senate from Capua did not take place till the year of the
city 705. Yet the Lucretius here spoken of was rather a relation of the poet, than the poet himself: for,
although from a similarity of year5‚ from mutual connexion& and, more than every thing else, a mutual at-
tachment, and open avowal and defencc of the Epicurean system, it is in the highest degree probable‚ and
indeed uniformly admitted, that the closest acquaintance and ⁷intercourse were maintained between Titus
Lucretius and Cassius 3 yet the former does not appear to have possessed a roving disposition, much less
a disposition to have travelled into a quarter of great political tumult and danger. It is said, that he once
accompanied his friend Caius Memmius to his government in Bythinia ; and, had Memmius been at this time
alive, and still in a state of esile, it would be much more reasonableto look for Lucretius in Greece, to which
place Memmius had been banished, than at Capua, in the midst of civil tumults and contending armies. The
Chronicle of Eusebius, therefore, continues still unimpeached, and we cannot do better than rely upon it.

There is more controversy among the crines, concerning the time when Lucretius died, than when
he was born ; for while Eusebius, and consequently St. Jerom, fix him to have been at this period sorty-
four years old, there are others who will not allow him to have been more than twenty-six 3 and, it is cu-
rious to observe, in what manner the present and similar mistakes have been copied from writer to writer,
and in every copy have exhibited some ingenious addition. Thus, Donatus kills him, or rather makes him
kill himself, on the very day in which Via-gil took his virile gown. “ Decimo septimo ann0‚” says he, ‘⁶ aetatis
virilem togam cepit, illis consulibus iterum quibus natus erat. Evenitquc ut eo ipso die Lucretius poeta
discederet.'' Vit. virg. P. Briet, whom Bayle has convicted of eight errors in his first eight lines, ac-
cords, in this instance, with Donatus. De Poetis Latinis. But Creech, who appears to have met with
some such anecdote, yet not to have remembered the story completely, declares, that he died, not on the
day of Virgil’s majority, bnt on that of his birth; and immediately adds, that a Pythagorean might hence
easily conceive, that the soul of Lucretius had instantaneously passed into the body of Vir-gil, and thus
at once inspired him with a truly poetic taste. “ Vix,'’ says he, ‘¹ absoluto opere moritur, eo ipso die quo
natus est Virgiliusg et aliquis Pythagoreus credat Lucretii animam in Maronis corpus transiisse, ibique
longo usu, et multo studio exercitatam poetam evasisse.’' In Praef. Lucr.

Equally erroneous, too, or, at least equally unfounded, is that report of Eusebius, that the paroxysm
of insanity in which Lucretius destroyed himself was produced by philtreS, administered to him by Lu-
cilia in a fit of jealousy, and with a view of recovering that affection which she was suspicioushe had be-
stowed on some other object: whence the commentator upon Creech’s English version, and after him
Guernier, have advanced a step farther, and, without the smallest authority, thrown out a hint that this
lady was perhaps his mistress, and not his wife, although she is expressly denominated his wife by Euse-
bius, St. Jeroui‚ and every early writer who has left us any tidings upon the subject. Who cloes not per-
ceive that the whole of this story of philtres and jealousy is a fiction founded upon the double fact of
the grief and alienation of our poet’s mind, and the fond and assiduous attention which Lucilia bestowed
upon him during his illness? And who does not, at the same time, perceivc an attempt to renovate the
same charge of voluptuousness, which was so maliciously advanced against Epicurus and his disciples in
former ages ?

But this is not the whole of the wonderful tale narrated in the Chronicle of Eusebius ; for he did not,
as it seems, kill himself upon first becoming insane, but lived many years afterwards, and, like Torquato
