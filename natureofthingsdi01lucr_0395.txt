Boou 11. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 247

Pregnant with pleasure3 or, perchance, the frame

Affecting inly, as th' essential seeds 445

Collect tumultuous, urg'd to civil strife.

A feeling, this, full oft educ'd amain

Whene'er th' uplifted palm, from sport or ire,

Lets fall its vengeance o’er the redd’ning· cheek.

’ Hence, from effects so various, various too 450

Must be the forms to primal seeds assign’d.

There are, moreo’er, that hard exist, and dense τ

From atomS, these, more crook’d and clinging spring,

Like tangled branches intertwin’d throughout.

Such, mid the foremost, shines the diamond's blaze, 4 5 5

Fearless of insult, such the valid ssim,

The steel's enduring vigour, and the bmss

Discordant creaking from the public gates.

While those, revers’d, a fluent power that boast

Swell into birth from seeds rotund, and smooth‚ 400

Unlink’d th' essentia] globuies‚ and with ease

open fly
With impetuous recoiL and jarring sound
Th’ infernal doure, and on their hinges grate
Harsh thuider, that the lowest bottom shook
⁹ Of Erebus. PAR. Losr, b. ii. v. 879.

Klopstock has occasion to vary the painting : for
with him the infernal door or gate leads to the man·
sions of the blest, his paradise being situated in the
centre of the carth. Hence, in the Messias, the
description runs thus 2

 

——schon stand der unsterblichen fuss an der hei-
ligen pforte‚
Die vor ihm, wie rausehender Cherubim ssdgei,
sich aufthat,
Hinter ihm wieder mit eile sich schloss.
Now stood th’ immortal at the heavenly
gate :
That with the soztnd of Cherub's rustling wIngs,
Op'd at his presence, and as quickly clos‘d.
