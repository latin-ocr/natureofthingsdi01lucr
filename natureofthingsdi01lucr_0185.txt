ΤΗΕ NATURE OF THINGS.

The various tribes of brutes‚ with ray divine,

To animate and quicken: though the bard,

In deathless melody‚ has elsewhere sung

Of ACHERUSIAN temples, where, nor soul

Nor body dwells, but images of men,

Mysterious shap'd3 in wondrous measure wan.

cay. This is lang-uage which has long been enter-
tained, even among Christian writers and philo-
sophers: and in demonstration of its truth‚ the sacred
Scriptures have, not unsrequcntly, and especially
by Grotius and Vitringa, been had recourse to.
Yet even here, as in most other concerns which
merely depend upon a luxurious imagination‚ the
moderns must decidedly yield to the Greeks 3 whose
popular creed established, for many ages, the ex-
istence of four principles, instead of three, in the
multifarious constitution of man. Three, indeed, are
here enumerated by Lucretius, who has, never-
theless, omitted the umbra, or shade, properly
so called, which was supposed to have its constant
residence about the tomb or sepulchre, where
the 'body was interred3 and was a principle, or
substance, altogether different from the ειδωλον, simu-
lacrum, or effigies, which for ever maintained its abode
in the lower regions, or, as Ennius has here denomi-
nated them, the Acherusian caves; whilst the anima,
the soul or spirit, was admitted to be a participant
in the Elysian fields. In conformity to this complex
idea, Homer has represented Ulysses, during his de-
scent into Tartarus, as conversing with the ειδωλον,
or manes of Hercules3 while, at the same time, he
himself, that is, his soul or spirit, was existing among
the gods.

’rav δε μετ’, εισενοησοι Hem ‘Hpoanhnsmb
Ειδωλον· αυτος Se μετ’ “Oeam-roim θεοισι

Τερπεται,ιν Salam, και Ηρης χρυσοπεὸιλου.

Ουγ ss. A. 600.

Now Ι the strength of Hercules behold,
A tow'ring spectre of gigantic mold,

A shadowyform! for, high in heaven's abodez

Himself resides ; a god among the gods.

There, in the bright assemblies of the skies,

He nectar qnaffs‚ and Hebe crowns his joys.

Virgil has represented the very same fact as taking
place with respect to Anchises, whose manes, his son,
AEneas, conversed with below, while his soul was re-
siding in the upper and blest abodes. Hence the
propriety of the following lines, which have been at-
tributed to Ovid:

Bis duo sunt homini: manes, caru, spiritus, umbra:
Qatuor ista loci bis duo suscipiunt.

Terra tegit carnem, tumulum circumvolat umbra,
Orcus habet manes, spiritus astra petit.

Four things are man's-flesh‚ spirit, ghost‚ and
shade ;
And four their final homes :—hell claims the ghost;
The spirit, heaven ; in earth the flesh is laid ;
And, hov'ring o’er it, seeks the shade its post.

on book iii. verse 100.
