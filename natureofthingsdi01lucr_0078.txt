lxiv THE LIFE OF LUCRETIUS.

inorality of Epicurus were levelled more immediately against the Stoics‚
than against any other philosophers. Zeno had opened his school but
a short time anterior to the arrival of Epicurus at Athens. There waS,
in reality, but little new in what he taught; it was rather a system of
eclectism, of general pillage and plunder from existing theories, than
the invention of an original philosophy. Yet his dogmas were an-
nounced in new and affected terms; they were intermixed with ab-
struse and unintelligible paradoxes, which is too generally conceived
in every age to be an unquestionable mark of wisdom and profound
resea1·ch; and these, by the external aid of gravity in speech, in dress
and demeanoux, obtained, for the inventor, a popularity so consider-
able, that the Academy‚ and almost every other school, was deserted
sor the Porch. The plan proposed by Epicurus, and his own natural
disposition, were directly the reverse of such mumlnery. Affable and
cheerful in himself, he saw no reason why man should become mo-
rose, in order to become wise ; the paths of wisdom, in his estimation,
ought to be paths of pleasantness, and virtue and happiness to walk arm
in arm. In opposition‚ therefore, to the Porch, he opened an elegant
and delightful Garden, and, instead of the grimace of external austerity‚
exhibited the most captivating urbanity of mannerS, and facility of ad-
dress. He denicd the absurd doctrine of fatality, the very pivot of the
Stoic machinery, and boldly contended for the free agency of man. The
school of Zeno had much, therefore, to dread, from such an adver-
sary ; its adherents beheld the Porch deserted in its turn for the Garden,
and, with malicious invention, endeavoured to destroy the fair fame

of their adversary by the base means I have already exposed.

But it was not w-ith the philosophy of the Porch alone that the new
school of the Gai-den interferedx The dialectics of the Academy and
of the Lyceum, and especially those of the former, were daily becom-
