THE NATURE OF THINGS.

Her priests are eunuehs—-emblem this devis’d

To teach that sons rebellious to their sires,

Or those the sacred fame that dare traduce

Of her who bore them, never shall themselves,

&Vorthless and vile, by gods and men abhorr’d‚

625

Boast aught of babe to glad their longing sight.

With vig'rous hand the clam'rous drum they rouse

And wake the sounding eymbal : the hoarse horn

Pours forth its threat’ning music, and the pipe

cal council, for not having had fortitude enough to

resist the temptations to which he was exposed, and
which constituted, it was added, a chief part of his
duty.
Ver. 627. With· vig’rous hand the clam’rous druia
they rouse
And wake the fhmzditzg cymbal : the homst horn]
This wild uproar and intermixture of instruments,
priests, and people‚ are thus imitated by Ariosto:

Un mnover d’arrne, un cori-er di persone,

E di talacimanni un gridar d'aho,

E di tamburi un suon misto, e di trombe

ll mondo assorda 3 e'l ciel par ne rimbombe.
ORLAnn. Fun. c. xviii.

The clash of arms, the concourse of the croud
Th' enraged priests alost, and stiouting loud,

Timbrils and trumpets with commingled sound,
Stun every ear, and thro' the heavens rebound.

A fimilar description is given us by Catullus, the
friend and contemporary of Lucretius ε

plangebant alii proceris tympana palmis
Aut tereti tenues tinnitus aere ciebant ε
Multis raucisonos ecflabant cornua bombos,
Barbaraque horribili stridebat tibia cantu.

lxiv. 264·

Some strike the drum with loud rebounding
roar;

Some through the taper trump shrill clangors
pour:

These the hoarse horn, while those discordant
stram

The shrieking pipe, till every nerve complain.

Ver. 629.

 

the pipe
With ΡΗκγοῐΑΝ airs distracts the madd’ning
mind5] The movement, termed by the
ancients‚ Phrygiam, was the most enthusiastic, and
best calculated to fill the soul with fury, of any
musical mode the Greeks were acquainted with ς and
was, in this respect, diametrically opposite to the
Lydian, which had more of the modern piano, and
was well adapted to subdue the fiercer passions of the
breast‚ or melt it into feelings of tenderness and
love. Dryden‚ therefore, has, with much critical ac·
curacy‚ represented the old minstrel Timotheus as
selecting this latter gem-is for the purpose of soften-
ing the violence of soul, to which he had just before
excited the Macedonian conqueror by the true Pluy-
gian movement ε

Softly sweet‚ in Lydian measures,
Soon he sooth'd his soul to pleasures.
