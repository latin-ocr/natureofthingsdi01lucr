xxxii THE LIFE OF LUCRETIUS.

his relation, whom Cicero, as Ι have already remarked, has enume-

rated among the orators of his day; Mai-cus Junius Brutus, Caius
Cassius, and Caius Velleius, each of whom immortalized himself by
preferring the freedom of his country to the friendship of Coesar; and
hence engaged in the patriotic conspiracy which only terminated
with their lives: these we know to have been contemporary stu-
dents3 and they may fairly be adduccd as a specimen of the very
flourishing state of thc Epicurean school at this period ⁴4.

q Tho sriendships contractcd in youth are the most durable‚ for they
arc the most honest and ‹lisinterestcd ; and it should be remarked to
tho praisc of these illustrious young men, that they never deserted
each other 111 future lifc; that the warmth of their juvenile attach-
ments increascd, rather than (liminished, with their years; and that in
thc midst of the misfortunes to which almost every one of them was
exposed 111 his turn, each was sure of receiving the utmost commise-
ration and assistance l'roin the rest. This too should be observed, in
praise of lhc principles they had imbibcd with their studies, and of the

⁴* Velleius Paterculus gives us the following catalogue of eminent and accomplished scholars who flou-
rished in the present age: “ Vidit,’' says lie, ·‘ Ciceronem, Senemque Crassum, Catonem, Sulpitium‚
moxque Brutum, Calidium, Calvum, Coelium‚ et proximum Ciceroni Caesarem, eorumque velut alumnos
Corvinum, nc Pollionem Asinium, remulumqne Thucydidis Sallustium, auctoresque carminumVarronem et
Lucam-ium, neque ullo iu suscepti operis sui carmine minorem Catullum‚'' lib. ii. To these he might
have added Qiintus Cicero, who was both a poet and a soldier ς Varro Atacinus, who translated into Latin
the Argonautics of Apollonius Rhodius, and wrote an heroic poem, “ de Bello Sequanic0,'’ besides Sa-
tires, Elegies. aud Epigrams, some of which appear to have been serviceable to Vir-gil: Rabirius, an epic
poet, a philosopher, a philologcr‚ and a critic, esteemed the most learned man of his age, and who com-
posed not less than 490 books or treatises on different subjects‚ enumerated by Cicero or Aulus Gellius ;
Qintus Hortensius, the celebrated orator, who was consul in 684 ; M. Marcellus, of equal merit and ta.
lenm, who was consul in 702, and whose son, Caius Marcellus, married Octavia, sister to Augustus;
Calpurnius Piso, consul in 605 ; Quintus Lutatius Catulus, the poet and historiari, consul, also, in 651 ;
and Anteius, one of the most distinguished characters of his age, who was likewise consul in 713. In the
earlier period of his life he was master to Sallust, and As'uiius Pollio, to the latter os whom Virgil dedicated
his fourth ecbgue, and who recommendcd Atteius to Maecenas. We have here, therefore, 3 galaxy of ta-
lents and learning, which neither the Augustan, nor any other age in the whole history of the Roman
repubhc, can presume to rival.
