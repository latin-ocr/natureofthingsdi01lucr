THE NATURE OF THlNGs.

Prompts in the panting breast, lest every tribe

Should fail on earth, the sites of Venus spurn’d.

These from the gods, as sovereign cause of all,

180

Such sophists trace, wide wand'ring from the truth.

For, though the rise of things I ne'er could prove,

Yet dare I, from the heaven's defective frasne,

And many a scene alike penserse, affirm

“ And every part of nature, proofs to shew

“ The world to gods cannot its being owe ;

“ So full of faults is all th' unartful frame.”-—

Thus impotent in sense, though strong 11. rage

The dai-ing Roman does the gods engage.
Canai-ion.

But Sir Richard has totally mistaken the meaning
of this “ dai-ing Roman :’' which, indeed, is not
very extraordinary, for almost all the commentators
have done the same. Far-*from attacking the eternal
intelligence and first cause of all things, in conse-
quence of the moral and physical evils of the world,
he accounts for them briefly here, and more fully in
the 5th book, by adverting to the nature of matter
itself. This, the Epicureans, in common with all the
other Greek phibsophers, conceived to have been
eternal, and uncreated. By its very nature, it is
subject to mutability in all its concrete forms; and
from its incessant changeS, decompositions‚ and re-
combinamus, proceed all the evils we meet with in
the world. But the intelligent First Cause, not hav-
ing created matter, of course could not alter its es-
sential tendencies ; he could only endue it with ccr-
tain powers of motion of which it was susceptible,
and thue benevolently draw forth its inactive cor-
puscles into forms of action and utility‚ of real,

though not of uninterrupted happiness. But had
this supreme intelligence created matter himself, it

would not, conjectures our poet, have exhibited the
evils it exhibite, at presents I am confident, there-
fore, adds he, that the intelligent First Canse could

not have created it, and I know whence these evils

proceed ε were I, however, ignorant of this, and had
formed no opinion upon subjects of cosmogony,

Yet dare Ι from the heaven‘s defective frame,
And many a scene alike perverse, affirm
No power divine this mass material rear’d

With ills so pregnant.

The contrary, as is well known, was generally
maintained: for the multitud-e attributed the abso-
lute creation of all things to the operation of some
one or more of their own absurd and inconsistent
gods: while, as I have already observed, the Stoic
and Platonic philosophers contended‚ that the world
itsclf was a god, or divine being, endor-:ed with intel-
ligence, and existing from all eternity. Here, in-
deed, if Ι mistake not, we meet with much impiety
and much absurdity3 and it is against these absurd
and impions opinions Lucretius levels his attack.

The origin of moral evil is very unsatisfactorily re-
soli-ed upon every hypothesis: but the eternity of
matter accounts for it far more explicitly than any
other system asserted in ancient times, either in
Greece or Rome. Happiest he, however, even
among ourselves, who resigns this intricate subjee‘t
altogether-3 and, retur-ning with suitable modesty to
the paths of common life, directs his views towards εἰ
future state for a full explanation of difficulties which,
even at present, he cannot surmount. But as the
most solid, if not the only, proofs of a future state
are deducible from Christianity‚ the whole, or the
greater part of them, could not possibly have been
known, either to the Grec-ian §age or Roman poet.
