Dicere porro oculos nullam rem cernere posse, 360

Sed per eos animum ut foribus spectare reclusis,

Difficile est, contra quom sensus ducat eorum3

Sensus enim trahit, atque acies detrudit ad ipsas :

Fulgida praesertim quom cernere saepe nequimus,

Lumina luminibus quia nobis praepeditlntur3 365

Christian tera. From the Persians and Chaldeans

his extensive travels and observations, acquired a vast ’
accumulation of general and profound science, he, at
length, determined to fix at Athens. To this city,
therefore, he resorted 3 and voluntarily surrendered to
the state all the property he was possessed of, during
his life-time, excepting a little garden, which he re-
served for privacy and contemplative walks. He
lived to a very advanccd age, and always looked for·-
ward to death without terror. Some time prior
to his decease, from a sudden and extreme debility,
his friends apprehended his end was at hand. His
sister was at this period engaged in the festivals of
Ceres, and declared that, if he then died, she should
not be able to perform her vows: in consequence of
