-ΒΕ RERUM NATURA.

Lm. 1.·

Armipotens regit, in gremium qui saepe tuum se

Rejicit‚ aeterno devictus volnere amoris :

35

Atque ita, suspiciens tereti cervice reposta,

Pascit amore avidos, inhians in te, Dea, visus3

so truly beautiful and delicate, that it may even be
quoted after the above passage in Milton. It occurs
in the second canto of most of the editions of the
Lusiad, but is unaccountably omitted in the small
copy of Manuel de Lyra, published at Lisbon in
1584. Goncalez had previously inserted it in his
of 15723 and Faria i Sousa has, with much pro-
priety‚ restored it in his splendid and illustrative edi-
tion of 1639:

Os crespos fios douro se eparziam

Pello colo, que a neve escurecia

Andando as lacteas tetas lhe tremiam

Com quem amor brincava, e nam se vim

Da alva patrina flamas lhe saiam,

Onde o minino as almas acendia.

Polas lisas columnas lhe trepavfio,

Desejos‚ que como era se eurolavfio, διε.

Adown her neck, more white than virgin snow,
Of softest hue the golden tresses flow ;
Her heaving brt-asts, of purer, softer white
Than snoxv-hills glist'ning in the moon⁷s pale light,
Except where cover’d by the sash, were bare,
And love, unseen, smil’d soft, and panted there.
Nor less t'he zone the god’s fond zeal employs,
The zone awakes the flames of secret joys.
As ivy tendrilS, round her limbs divine,
Their spreading arms the young desires entwine;
Below her waist‚ and quiv'ring on the gale,
Of thinuest texture flows the silken veil,
(Ah ἒ where the lucid curtain dimly shows,
&Vith double fires the roving fancy glows !)
The hand of modesty the foldings threw,
Nor all conceal'd‚ nor all was given to vieW.
Micxuz.
Ver. 36. Struck [ι] triumphant love’s etcrnal wouna']
Thus Virgil, imitating the same passage :
T um pater ,τίει-ἰο fatur devinctus amore.
7 [En. viii. 394.

Then thus the sire, by love eterna! struck.

In the following of Petrarc, the similitude is equal,
but results from 3 different idea :

Ma le ferite impresse

Volgon per forza il cor piegato alti-ove
Ond’ io divento smorto 3

E’l sangue si nasconde, i non so dove.

The wounds she then made me sustain

Fix’d my wandering beart on the fair 5

1 grew pale through each limb with the pain,
And my blood fied—1 cannot tell where.

Ver. 3i8. On thee he seeds his longing lingering eyes]
In the original, ‘⁶ pascit amore avidos—visus‚’' lite-
rally “ feeds his voracious eyes with love.'’ Thus
Virgil, adopting the same metaphor,
animum pictura pascit inani.

He, with th’ unsolid picture, fteds his mind.
AEu. i. 468.

And Claudian, with a still closer reference to Lu-

 

cretius :
Illecebris capitur, nimiumque elatus, avaro
Ruris. i. 164,

Pascitur intuitu.

Her charms entrance him, and, with love elate,

Hefecrls his eyes voracious.

This elegant comparison of the fascinating power
of love to a delicious aud intoxicating feast, has by
no means been disregarded by modern poets: but, in
general, the latter have rather employed the intoxi-
cating cup, in their similes, than the more solid viands
of the banquet5 a deviatiou of which Apuleius set
au early example. Thus, lib. iii. of his Transforma-
tion into an Ass ι Admissis et sorbillantibus suaviis,
sitienter hauriebam3 “ Thirsly I (lt-ank lhe soft con-
