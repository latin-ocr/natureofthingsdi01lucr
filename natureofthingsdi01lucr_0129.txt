APPENDIX. cxv

It must be confessed, however, that Epicurism, which thus main-
tained its sway at Rome, obtained at no time any great degree of fa-
vour at Alexandria, where, under the Ptolemies, learning and learned
men received the most flattering encouragement; and which continued,
under the Roman emperorS‚ to be the chief seat of philosophy and
seience. For this contempt it is, nevertheless, easy to account. The
warin and elevated minds of the Asiatics are possessed of more imagi-
nation than judgrnent ; they are fond of what is marveilous, and pre-
fer the splendour of mysticism to the beautics of simplicity. lt was
from this quarter that Pythagoras derived his system, and much of
its aenigmatie involution was artfully transferred into their own doc-
trines, both by Plato aud Aristotle. The Orientalists were, therefore,
hence, prepared for the tenets os the Samian, Academic, and Peripa-
tetie schools‚ while the students of the latter formed a ready alliance²
not only with the scientific arcana ot' the magi, gymnosopliists, and
Egyptian priests, but with the vulgar superstitious and vernaculas tra-
ditions of the country. Hence, in a century or two after the com-
mencement of the Christian aera, there was not a single school in this
celebrated mart for learning, whether Greeian or Asiatic, that retained
its purity. A change of some kind became necessary, and it was at-
tempted3 not, however, as it ought to have been, by a return to first
principles, but by a pretended selection, from every system, of that
which was conceived to be its essential or most valuable doctrines:
whence, a new order of philosophy sprang up, more absurd and hete-
rogeneous than any which had preceded it; and this, from the choiee
which was thus exercised, its advocates denominated Ecleetism. Of
this confused amalgamation, or rather general plunder of opinions,
Potamo is said to have been the inventor3 but, as from Platonism a
larger share had been stolen than from any other theory, and as the name
of Plato still preserved a large portion os its primaeval repnte and vene-
ration, the greater body of the Eclectics continued to denominate them-
selves Platonists, notwithstanding their innovation upon his doctrine.
