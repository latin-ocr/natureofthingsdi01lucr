THE LIFE OF LUCRETIUs. xci

stance not subject to the changes and infirmities os matter, and alto-
gether impalpable and incorruptible. But if sensatior] and ideas can
only result from such a substance in man, they can only result from a
possession of the same substance by brutes: and hence the level be-
tween the two is equally maintained by both partite, the common ma—
terialist lowering the man to the brute, and the immaterialist exalting
the brute to the man: The immaterialist, however, on the approach
of dissolution, finds a difficulty to which his antagonist is not
subject, for he kuows not, at that period, how to dispose ofthc bru-
tal soul: he cannot destroy an incorruptible and innnatcrial sub-
stance, and yet he cannot bring himself to a belief that it is immortal.
This difficulty is extreme, and no svstem that has hitherto been in-

vented has been able to surm· some immaterialists‚ and

spiriu but such an idea, while it absurdly supposes every man to be
created with two immaterial spirits instead of one, leaves us as much

as ever in the dark as to the one immaterial, and, consequently, in-
corruptible soul or principle possessed by brutos. The insufficiency

of the solution has not only been felt but acknowledged by other
immaterialists, aud nothing cau silence the objection, but to advance
boldly, and deny that brutos have a soul or percipient principle of
any l;ind; that they have either thought, perception, or sensation;
and to maintain, in consequence, that they are mere mechanical ma-
chines, acted upon by external impulsions alone. Des Cartes was
sensible that this was the only alternative3 hc, therefore, cut the Gor-
dian knot, and strenuously contendcd for such a theory ; and Peligna&
who intrepidly follows lziln, gravely devotes almost a whole book οῖ’
his Anti-Lucretius to the elucidation of this doctrine3 maintaining‚
