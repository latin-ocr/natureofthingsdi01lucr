xxxviii THE LlFE OF LUCRETIUS.

Sweet the new flow’rs that bloom 3 but sweeter still
Those flow'rs to pluck, and weave a roseat wreath
The muses yet to mortals ne'er have deign’d.

With joy the subject Ι pursue-—and free

The captiv’d mind from superstition’s yoke:

It is by no means an easy point to ascertain the period in which
this poem was written. From the evidence of its introductory address‚
it was at least commenced, when Memmius was in his zenith of po-

interna] broils, and foreign wars. Taking this, therefore, as a postulate
to compute from, I have no hesitation in referring it to about the year
of the city 695. Caius Memmius, who had been praetor in 689, and
appointed to the governinent of Bithynia in 691, had at this time re-
turned srom his prefecture; Clodius, by his intrigues, had acquired
the control of the forum ; and, by the connivance of both Pompey and
Caesar, had succeeded in obtaining a formal decree of banishment
against Cicero: the Asiatic war against Mithridates, and his allies, was
but just closed, and that with the Helvetii was in its midmost vio-
lence. Lucretius, at this period, must have been in his thirty-eighth
year. It is some proof of the popular influence which was now pos-
sessed by Caius Memmius, that Caesar, notwithstanding the glory he
had already attained, and was still in the act of attaining by his mar-
tial exploits, found himself compelled to drop a public accusation, he
had at one time determined to bring forwards against him. The ori-
gin of this dispute we know not3 but the’re is little doubt ofits having
proceeded from the warmth, with which Memmius had espoused the
cause of Cicero, and it hence becomes highly creditable to his vir-
tue: through life there was the closest attachment between them, and
