THE NATURE OF THINGS.

219

Void of all contest, all re-active blow‚

Whence nature sole her world of wonders works.

If, then, there be, who deem the seeds of things

More pond’rous, as their rectilinear course

Speeds through the void, the lighter soon may reach,

And thus the repercussive war commence,——

Far err they from the truth. For though, when urg'd

Through the pure air, or clear translucent xvave, 2

Doubtless, all pond’rous forms‘more swift descend ;

This, from the variance of resistance sole,

Flows, by such fluids form'd

’gainst things unhke,

The grosser quick-o’erpow'ring. But pure space,

In every part, in every hour the same, 240

Throughout resists not, the demanded path

Yielding submissive.

Hence, in equal time,

Through the blank void, unequal weights descend

Of every fancied variance: and hence, too,

heavy. It is the very philosophy of Lucretius, and
expressed in nearly the same terms. All the argu-
ments, therefore of Des Car-tes, Pelignac, and even
the earlier adherents among the Greeks to the doe-
trine ofa plenum, when urged on this subject, are
as much addressed to the philosophy ofNewton as of
Epicurus, and are answered in the same mannen—If
there be any difficulty in conceiving the origin of
gravitation‚ or the power of attraction between
body and body, when at a distance from each other,
and when we are incapable of discerning any medium
of communication, there is certainly a much greater
difficulty in conceiving‚ as Lucretius has justly ob-
served in the former book, »how motion of any sort

could ever be generated, if the whole of nature were
full of matter equally solid. There is a much greater
difficulty in conceiving‚ with Des Cau-tes, that a
body descends from above by propulsion, or because
the atmosphere is already so crowded with material
substanceS, that it cannot admit the entrance of any
thing projected towards it‚-—than in conceiving, with
Lucretius, that it descends by the possession of uni-
versal gravity; or, according to Newton, by the pro-

>perty of mutual attraction, which is the cause of

such gravity. For a fuller account of the different doc-
trines that have been occasionally maintained on this

subject, I refer the reader to the note on ver. 1065,

of the present book.
