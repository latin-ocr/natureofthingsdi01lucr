DE x RERUM NATURA.

Lm. II.

Nec contra pugnant, in promptu cognita quae sunt ;

Sed magis ipsa manu ducunt, et credere cogunt,

 

mere combination of material atoms, but of atoms

--—nor could it, indeed, have been otherwise the sub-

organized in a peculiar mode ε and that the whole ἱε, ject 0f material vision‚—-impalpably attenuated and

hence, equally perishable, and must equally dissolve
at death. The former part of thc proposition alone,
the creation of perception and sense from imperci-
pient atoms, is discussed in the remainder of the
present book ι the latter part, or the mortality of the
percipient principle, together with a variety of moral
and philosophie deductions, unrivalled in their beauty
and sublimity‚ form the basis of the cnsuing.

In advancing this proposition, our poet had to
contend equally against the popular creed, and the
systems of other philosophers; but with a consist-
ency which, I think, must be allowed him, even by
those who differ from him in opinion, he follows up
his principles through every legitimate avenne, and
developes a chain of reasoning from vital facts and
experiinents, which has been seldom equalled by any
philosopher upon the same subject since, and, as far
as Ι arn acquainted, sui-passed by no one. From the
Christian scriptures‚ indeed, those oracles of divine
and unerring reason, we are clearly taught, in my ap-
prehension‚ not only that there will be a resurrection of
the body, proper-lyso called, but that the soul does not
perish with the body at denum surviving its ruins,
and being admitted, if virtuous‚ to a state of sepa-
rate felicity. In this respect, therefore, the re-
snlt ot our poet's argument is erroneous: but, so
far as it relaxes to the common origin of the whole
inan, tu the materiality of the soul itself‚ it appears
to me altogether unanswerable, and by no means
contradictoiy to revelation. To render the soul im-
moi-tal, why is it necessary that it should be immate-
rial? If, at the resurrection, the body at large will itself
become immortal, why may not that portion, or ar.
rangtment of it, which is the source of thought, be
immortal from its birth? Or why should it be sup-
pos-ed more difficult for thought to originate from
matter, than gravitation, or any other property which
it uncquivocally posseses? In every instance iu which
the soul is rcprtsentcd in tlte Scriptures to have ap-
peared after (lt-aith, it lias appeared in a material form ;

refined, but still material, and capable of identifica-
tion; freed from the laws of gravity, and able to
permeate the pores of grosser substances. There is
an insuperable difficulty that attaches to the doctrine
of two distinct substances united in the human frame,
of powers and qualities in every respect adverse to,
and inconsistent with, each other, and possest of no
common medium of action; and the war between
Materialists and Immaterialists, as hitherto con-

ducted, can never terminate. Admit that matter is

competent to the whole ; that, in a certain arrange-
ment or modification, it can think ς that, in the same
state it becomes attenuated, etherial, or spiritualized 3
that such a modification of it is immortal from its
first developement‚ and every difficulty appears to
vanish : a point of union is discoverable for antago-
nists, who seemed to be incapable of conciliation,
and the sublime doctrines of revelation become coin-
cident with human reason.

The grand motive for superadding an immaterial
principle to living animals‚ is, because it is conceived
that mere matter can never possess the power of sen-
satior· or thought. But why can it not possess such
a power? Unquestionably, it cannot, in its state of
utmost decomposition and simplicity: for, thus re-
duced, there is scarcely a power of any kind it can
possess at all⁴ But whocver minuteiy attends to the
progressive chain of powers it acquires by progres-
sive arrangements and organizations, from the simple
possession of gravitation to that of chemical affinities,
and fibrous irritability, must, I think, be led eventu-
ally to admit that it may ultimately prore the source
of perception and thought, as wellas of such other
qualities. Mr. Locke declared openly, that lie saw no
impossibility in the productiori of thought from a solid
substance, and corceived, (Book II. chap. 23 of his
Essay,) that ‘⁶ created spirits arc not totally separate
from matter.’‘ It is hence triumphantly said, that Mr.
Lovke himself ought, even upon his own principles,

to have been a Materialist. For, to suppose the em-
