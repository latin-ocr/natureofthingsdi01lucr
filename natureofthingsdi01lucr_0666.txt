516 DE RERUM NATURA. Lus. 111.

Nec miser inpendens magnum timet, aere, saxum
Tantalus, ut fama est, cass& formidine torpens ;
Sed magis in vit& divom metus urguet inanis 995
Mortaleis3 casumque timent, quern quoique ferat fors.
Nec Tityon volucres ineunt, Acherunte jacentem3
Nec, quid sub magno scrutentur pectore, quidquam
Perpetuam aetatem possunt reperire profecto,
Quam lubet inmani projectu corporis exstet: 1000
Qui non sola novem disparsis jugera membris
Obtineat, sed qui terra'r‘ totius orbem,
Non tamen aeternum poterit perferre dolorem3
Nec praebere cibum proprio de corpore semper.
Sed Tityos nobis hicc’ est, in amore jacentem 1005

Quem volucres lacerant, atque exest anxius angor:

Which thou canst only touch, but never taste The stone for ever seem’d to fall,
Th’ abundance still, and still the want does last. And fill'd his joyless beart with dread.

a large rock impending over his head, the dread of Orchomenus. He attempted to force Latona, the
whose fall for ever terrifice him. In this delineation mother of Apollo by Jupiter, to his libidinous de-
he is supported by many of the Greek poets, parti· sires: for which he was sentenced to the punishment
