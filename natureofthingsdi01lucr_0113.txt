THE LIFE OF LUCRETIUS. xcix

hitherto been made public. Cicero, notwithstanding the enmity ho
had manifested against Epicurism from the moment of his desertiug
this system of philosophy, out of reg-ard to the memory of his de-
ceased friend, undertook to become his editor, and to revise it in the
few places where revision was necessary, This 'task‚ it is probable,
hc exectited about a twelvemonth afterwards, during the winter he
spent in Cilicia3 the government and protection of which was, at
that time, committed to his hands ἦέ.

Tasso, or our own lamented Cowper, evinced‘regular alvern21301is of reaso'n and derangcrnent ; during the
intervals of which malady‚ like these two poets also, he composed the greater part of the work that
has immortalized him. That he may have been subject, during his last illue-ss, to some alter-nating insanum
is by no means improbable, but not from the ridiculous cause of an amorous philtre communicated to 'nim
in a fit ofjealousy‚ and especially the sort of philtre employed by mistake upon this occasion, which, ac-
cording to St. Jerom, was aconite or monks huod.. ‘⁵ Illa sponte sua‚” says he, “ miscuit aconitum .· Lucilia
deceptajizt·0rem propinavit, pro amoris poculo.” That. moonkslmod will speedily and* effectually poison is,
I suppose, known to every one, but that it should produce the marvellous effect of a pei-lodic madness.
will not bo very readily accredited by botanists or physicians. Giffanius has well observed, that the whole
story reposes upon no authority, and is entitled to no belief; and he hence attributes the poet's decease,
with far more probability, to the cause assigned in the text.

’¹‘ There has been along and idle contest among the critics, whether the six ensuing books of the
Nature of Things be the whole of which the poem ever comisted. The question originated from a casua!
assertion of Varro, that a verse, not now to be found in any part of it, formed the beginning of its twen.
ty.first book: but Varro does not mention, whether it were the twenty-first book of ΤΗε Narona op
Tantos, or of some other poem Lucretius may be supposed to have written, and which Frachctta con.
ceives he actually did write. Had this, however, been the fact, it is almost impossible that we should
not have been made acquainted with its title, and its object, as well as possessed some other fragments
besides this one solitary verse of Varro, delivered down to us, either ¹by Priscian, Tertullian, Lactantius,
Arnobius,' or Donatus, who have quoted so largely from all the six books of the Nature of Things. At
the same time, it is scarcely possible, upon a minute and critical examination of the Nature os Things,
to conceive that any additional book could either have preceded or been superadded to those, of which
the poem consists in its preserved form. lt comprizes a perfect whole as it exists at present ; and no di-
dactic poem I am acquainred with, either ancient or modern, has fairer pretensions to the harmonicus com-
bination ofa beginning, a middle, and an end. lts objectis to develop the principles of the philosophy
of Epicurus. It commences, therefore, with it‘s first rudiments: it exhibi s and establishes its general
doctrines; and it then applies those doctrines to the explanation of all the phaenomcna of nature: the most
familiar, as well as the most abstruse. The two last boola, indeed, may be regarded as a kind of dra-
matic denoue'ment or peripoetia of the whole3 in which. from the principles progressively advanccd, every
event is accounted for, and rendered luminous. The dark curtain of nature is, as it were, undrawn : hu
multifarious wheels are at work before us—and the vast and entire machine is presented in all its cone
nexions and dependencies. Ῑ cannot, therefore, but agree with Giffazu'm in conceiving, that eitherx'arso,
