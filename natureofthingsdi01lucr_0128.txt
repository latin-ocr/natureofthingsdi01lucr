Lucian is sar better known as a serere but humorous satirist than
as a politician or philosopher, though he has some pretensions to no-
tice in 1110 two last characters He flourished under Aurelius Antoni-
nus, by whom he was appointed procurator of Egypt with a liberal
Salary. Philosophic tenets of every kind seem 10 have sat but loosely
upon 111111; yet, in his DialogueS, he always treats his avowed master
with respect, and 110 15 almost 1110 only philosopher to whom he is de-
cently civil. He unwarrantably misrepresents Socrates, and declares
Epicurus to have been the only sage who retained a sound intellect in
the midst of madnien and fools. To the writings of Diogenes Laertius
I have already had frequent occasion to refer. He lived in the begin-
ning of the third century of the Christian aera, and is well known to
the republic of letters as a most diligent biographer. According to
Jonssius, 110 acquired 1110 snrname of Laertius from having been born
at Laertes, a small city of Cilicia ἕ ε and he did what every man should
do who is in pursuit of 1111111, and 1135 sufficient leisure for the purpose.
With an active and unbiassed mind, he profoundly investigated all the
different systems that were proposed 1ο him by the literature of the
Greeks; and having ininutely appreciated the pretensions and merits
of each, he gave his hearty suffrage in favour of Epicurus, and imme-
diately began to collect, into one regular 11301, 311 1110 scattercd frag-
ments that ν101101113111011 of 111111 relative to his person, 1115 principles,
anci 1115 practice. Laertius, from many of the idionis he has adopted,
, appears to have been acquainted with the writings of the Christian fa-
111015, and has hence been believed 1011310 been a Christian himself.
