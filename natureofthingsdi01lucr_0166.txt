DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. Ι.

Eque tuo pendet resupini spiritus ore.

In quoting the whole of this description, with high
commendation, Ῑ am surprised that this manifest in-
congruity should have escaped, as it has done, the
eagle eye of Dr. VVarton. See his Reflections on
Didactic Poetry.

Ver. 39. And all h1'ssoul hangs quiv’rI‘ng from thy 1'1'ps.]
It is as little possible to do justice to the original of
this line as of the foregoing, v. 38.

Eque tuo pendet resupini spiritus ore.

An idea somewhat analogous is to be found in
ode vii. of Anacreon.
Κροι-ῗιη ἒς praec αχρις
Ανεςοιινη· >cxv απεο-ςην.
Now to my lips my heart was flying,
And all my quiv’ring soul was dying.
But perhaps the nearest approximation, in point
of merit, is to be traced in the justly celebrated
ode of Sappho, so admirably translated by Ca-

tullus into Latin, and by Phillips into our own lan·
guage ε

’Twas this bereav’d my soul of rest,
And rais’d such turnults in my breast3
For while Jgaz'd‚ in transport toss’d,
My breath was gone, my voice was lost.

It has generally been allowed that the whole of
this exquisite invocation is original. St. Pierre is the
only critic I have met with who does our poet the
injustice to contend, that it is a copy; and the reader-
will smile when he is informed that the worthy Abbe
suspects him to have been pilfering from the apocry-
phal book of Ecclesiasticus. The passage to which he
refers is contained in chap. 24, from ver. 5 to ver. 27.
Of this sublime delineation he has given a version in
French prose, as he has also os the present address of
Lucretius, for a companion with each other; and
having finished the former, he thus concludes ε
“ Cette foible traduction est celle d’une prose Latine

“ Grec l'a έῑὲ lui-meme de l’chreu. On doit donc.
