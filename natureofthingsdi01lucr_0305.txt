substance chuse, possest

Of pow'r t' impede, and check its rapid race:

Or let it Hy unconquer'd, nor restraint

E'en once encounter: thou must still confess

Th' ENTrRE of nature nought of limit knows.

Throughout the dart I'll chase 3 and when, at length,
Th' acceded bound is gain'd, I’ll still demand

What yet obstructs it; still new proofs adduce
That the vast whole is boundless 3 and that ssight

Still beyond ssight for ever might be urg'd.

denominate an obstacle, a body. If this body, or
obstacle, did not exist, Ι should be able to persevere
in my motion. Hence, from that which does not
prevent me from moving, and from that which does,
from nothing, and from bonfy, Ι derive the idea of
space. I call it ‘void if Ι find nothing, and full if I
meet with bodies. It is therefore impossible to know
whether space be a substance or a quality ; for it is
not, strictly speaking, either the one or the other:
it is an abstract idea, cornpounded of those of body
and nomentity, considered with relation to my sense
of motion. If any one inqmire of me, whether space
exist beyond the bounds of the Universe, I reply,
that beyond the bounds of the whole, there exists no-
thing3 and that, if Ι were there, I should certainly
not be incommoded in moving.’' Mem. de l’Instit.
Nat. Phys. et Mor. Ι. Μ. Cabanis is, however, in
as great a dilemma as the cardinal ε to move into no-

thing, is precisely the same thing as not to move at all.
How is he to know that he moveS‚ or whatis to mea-

sure his progress ? How would he, as a human being

1040

at least, derive a support for⁴his feet, or air for his
lungs ? Ι may sasely say, that he would not move far.

It is highly probable, Virgil had his eye directed
to this passage of our poet in composing the verses
that follow, although Ι do not find that the resem-
blance has been hitherto noticed by any of the com-
mentators on either poet. Admitting the imitation,
the passage, I think, will assume a new beauty‚ and
acquire an illustration that it wants.
