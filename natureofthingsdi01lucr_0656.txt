DE RERUM NATURA.

L‘113. ΙΙΙ.

Ex animo ut dicant, “ Brevis hicc' est fructus homullis ε

“ Jam fuerit3 neque post umquam revocare licebit !’'

Tamquam in morte mali cum primis hoc sit eorum,

Quod sitis exurat miseros atque arida torreat,

Aut aliae quoius desiderium insideat rei.

Nec sibi enim quisquam tum se vitamque requiret,

Quom pariter mens et corpus, sopita, quiescunt;

Nam licet aeternum per nos sic esse soporem:

Fair ones ! here on roses laid,
Careless will we quqff the bowl.

There is a custom of high antiquity still retained
in Wales, which is not very different from this of
Greece and Arabia3 but which, in point of inno-
cence and picturesque effect, is far more commend-
able: I mean that of collecting and strewing roses,
and other odoriferous flowers, at the annual village
wake of sheep-shearing, antecedently to the banquet
which is afterwards liberally provided for the artless
and honest swains. These fragrant flowers, how-
ever, are not strewed in the open shade‚ under the
coolness of which the feast is celebrated ; but, with a
kind of religionis rite, borrowed, perhaps, many an
age agn, from the borderers upon the Ganges,
sprinklcd over the river, in whose purifying stream
the ceremony of sheep—shearing has just been com-
pleted‚ and whose limpid fulness affor-ds thern the
fairest promise of plenty for the ensuing year. Dyer‚
in his ffleece, has not neglected to avail himself of
this picturesque custom ; and he thus notices it with
true poetic skill :

 

with light fantastic toe the nymphs

Thither assembled, thither every swain ι

And οὐν the dimpled stream a thousand flowem,

Pale lilies, roses, violets, and pinks,

Mixt with the greens of humet, mint, and
thyme,

And trefoil² sprinkled with their sportive arms.—

Such custom holds along th* irr÷g11ous vales.

From Wreakin's brow to rocky Dolvoryn,
Sabrina's early haunt, ere yet she fied

The search of Guendolen, her step-dame prouti,
With envious hate enrag'd. The jouy cheer
Spread on a mossy bank, untouch'd abides

Tiu cease the rites ; and now the mossy bank
Is gaily circled, and the jolly cheer

Dispers'd in copious measureS. Βοοκ I.

Ver. 948. As g'f, in death, the worn such wretches
fiar’d
lVere thirst unquenched, parching ev’ry nerve,]
It is probable, our poetic moralist alludes, in this
place, to the following of that hoary but musical
drunkaxd, Anacreon:

Πολικι στεφοισι ›capav-
Δος ὕδωρ, Βοιλ) onor ω παι,
’rm ψυχην μου καρωσον.

Βρακυ μη ζωντα καλυπτεις,
Ο Sam ουκ

Thus elegantly, but diffusively translated by Mr-
Moore:

επιθυμει. Om: xxxvi.

Age begins to blanch my brow,

l’ve time for nought but pleasure now.
Fly—and cool my goblet's glow

At yonder fountain’s gelid flow;

1³11 quaff, my boy, and calmly sink
This soul to slumber as I drink.

Soon‚ too soon, my jocund slave,
You’ll deck your master’s grassy grave;
