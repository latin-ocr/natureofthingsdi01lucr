THE NATURE OF THINGS.

Lest, hence, thou ope the doors of death to all.

But though material atoms thus live void

Of hue ; still many a diff ’ring form is theirs,

XVhence hues they gendes, and their variance stamp.

Much, then, import th’ arrangement, and the powerS,

The kinds, connexions of primordial seedS,

Positions, impulse, and effects impell'd3

Since, hence, with ease the mind may, instant, trace

Why· what is black this moment, should, the next,

Pour o'er the view with alabaster dye.

Thus, when loud tempests tear the tortur’d main,

While the latter asserts that

Here solid billows of enormous size
Alps of green icc in wild disorder rise.

So much, as Lucretius observes, a few verses above :

—imports th' arrangement and the powers,
The kinds, connexions of primordial seeds,
Positions, impulse, and effects impell’d.

Dr. Huttou seems to suppose, that the water of‘
the sea, at a distance from the coasts, is generally of
a dark blue, and that it becomes green as it ap-
proaches land, from an intermixture of yellowish
mu‹1; the natural blue and the adventitious yellow
forming this colour. This, however, seems to be an
unsatisfactory solution of the phrenomenom and one
that will not universally apply. [n quoting this
gentleman’s opinion, which I do from his translation
of Ozanam's Recreations, I cannot avoid copying a
most singular appearance of the sea-water, as to its
assuming a variety of colours, which he himself
witnessed in his passage from Europe to Guyana, in
the year 1754, and which he thus relates:

“ I do not recollect that we beheld the sea lumi-
nous till our arrival between the tropics ; but at that

7

period, and some weeks before we reached land, I
almost constantly observed that the ship’s wake was
interspersed with a multitude of luminous sparks‚
and so much the brighter as the darkness was more
perfect. The water round the rudder was, at length,
entirely brilliant ; and this light emended, gradually
diminishing, along the whole wake. Ῑ remarked‚
also, that if any of the ropes were immersed in the
water, they produced the same effect.

“ But it was near land that this spectacle ap-
peared in all its beauty. It blew a fresh gale, and
the whole sea was covered with small waves‚ which
broke, aster having rolled for some time. WVhen a
wave broke, a flash oflight was produced ; so that
the whole sea, as far as the (yos could reach, seemed
to be covered with fire, alternately kindled and ex-
tinguished. This firc, in the open sea, that is, at
the distance of fifty or sixty leagues from the
coasts of America, had a reddish cast. Ι have made
this remark, because Ι do not know that any person
ever examined the phaenomena which 1 am about to
describe.

‘⁸ then we were in green water, the spectacle
changed. The same fresh gale continuem but in
the night-time, when steeringan easy course between
