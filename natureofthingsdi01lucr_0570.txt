Ut quiddam fieri videatur ab omnibus unum :

Ne calor, ac ventus seorsum, seorsumque potestas

Aeris, interimant sensum, diductaque solvant.

Est etiam calor ille animo, quem sumit in ira,

Quom fervescit3 et ex oculis micat acribus ardor.

Est et frigida multa, comes Formidinis, aura ;

Qua ciet horrorem membris, et concutit artus

Ver. 297. Heat springs superior in the mind enrag'd, Theophrastus. But the doctrine of Temperaments‚

inculcated by these latter philosophers‚ and strenu-

Lucretins now proceeds to the doctrine of Tempera- ously supported by Galen himself, differed essentially

ments, or Idiosyncracies; and endeavours to prove,
that the moral habit of man depends upon the relative
quantity of the different component parts of atmo-
spheric air that are separated and absorbed by dif-
ferent systems: that those which separate and ab·
sorb a larger proportion of caloric or elemental heat
are naturally disposed to irascibility, and the more
violent passima, and so of the rest. The doctrine
of Temperaments was admitted into the system of all
the Greek philosophers. Omnes antiqui, says Ga-
len, in hoc videntur concordati, corporis complexionem
animae sequi virtutem. Tom. vi. De Incantatione,
“ They all appear to have coincided in this fact, that
the virtues of the soul arc derived from the peculiar
constitution of the body.'’ Galen, however, attri-
butes the origin of this hypothesis to Aristotle and

from that of Epicurus, as being derived from the
greater or less relative proportion of some one of the
four elements over the rest, in the formation of the
animal machine :—substances which were asserted,
by the Epicureans, to be no more elemental than any
other substances, and to be alike produced from the
common primordial corpuscles of matter united in a
peculiar arrangement. The doctrine of Aristode,
nevertheless, took the lead in the Arabian schools
of physic, as it did also in those of philosophy 3 and,
with the resurrection of sciencc in Europe, mankind
were universally affirmed to be of a hot, or cold, a
moist, or dry temperament, according to the pre-
ponderance in their constitutions, of fire, air, water,
or earth. But Galen had long before contended,
that in some constitutions, there was not merely a
