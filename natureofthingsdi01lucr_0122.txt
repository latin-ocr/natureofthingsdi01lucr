tinent and tyrannical. The soul of man he conceived to be of a su-
perior nature to this soul of the world, to have emanated originally from
the Supreme Divinity, and by him to have been planted, for some cause
not clearly ascertahred, in different stars or planets ; where it is

on earth : on the dissolution of which, the soul, if virtuous, refunds or
remigrates to the Divinity itself; if vicious‚ is sentenced to a material

1 now proceed to the consideration of the Atomic theory, which, in
the hands of Democritus, supposed the existence of matter alone, di-
vided into an infinite multitude of primary or elementary particles, of
which some were eternally intelligent, and others eternally senseless
and incogitative; and hence incapable of resist'ing the action of the
former, by whose control over them, and union with them, the visible
world was produced. Under the plastic hands of EpicuruS, however,
the atomio philosophy assumed a very different, and much more ra-

tional appearance. Matter with him consisted of an infinite multiplicity
of elementary corpuscles ; of which the whole were equally unintelligent
and senseleSS, and solely operated upon in the work of creation by an
immaterial Divinity ᾗ, “ possessed of all immortality and beatitude,’'
and ‘through the medium of a system of “ immutable laws which they
received at the commencement of the universe †·,” and which will con-

and unbounded, which have equally existed from all eternity‚ and
