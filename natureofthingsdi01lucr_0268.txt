ever, it submits to a variety of changes, which proves
obviously that such organs possess, of themselveS, a
considerable power over it. While some parts of the
body abound with electricity, others are deficient in
proportion to their capacity. The experiments of
Buniva prove that the electricity of the blood is posi-
tive‚-of the excrementitious fluids, negative ; and
these have been since fully confirmed by M. Vassali-
Eandi. It is, perhaps, by a similar economy, that
the luminous matter exhibited in a concrete state by

. the glow—worm and fire-fly, (lampyris Italica) is se-

parated from their food, or the atmosphere that sur-
rounds them. In the latter of these, it has been
sufficiently ascertaincd by M. Carradori (See Brug-
natelli's Annali di Chimica)‚ that the phosphoreseent
fomes, when separated and collected, resides in the
cells of the abdomen between the rings; and that
the appearance and disappearance of the light, con-
sidered as voluntary‚ depend on the insect’s power of
opening and closing those cells.

If this solution be admitted, with respect to the
secretiori or separation of light in living animals, we
may easily extend the conjecture, and account, upon
a similar principle, for its separation and efflux from
putrescent animal and vegetable substances, sea-wa-
ter, and rotten timbers.

Upon the whole, it should seem then, consistently
with the doctrine developed in the poem before us,
that all things proceed from the same primary ele-
mental sads, or atoms, and are convertible into all
things ; and that the modification or arrangement of
such atoms alone, produces the difference between
substances and substances ς or, to adopt the language
oijucretius, that
in alternate course

 

Each flows from each, th’ alternate form is seiz’d
'rh’ alternate nature through perennia] time. i. 828.

And from whom did Sir Isaac Newton dex-ive his
hypothesis, but from the same school, when he as-
serted that it is probable God, in the beginning,
formed matter in solid, massive, hard, impenetrable·
and moveable particles, of such sizes and figures, and
with such other properties as were best proportioned
to the end they were to produce ἒ and that the
changes of corporeal things are to be placed only to
the various separations‚ and new associations, and mo-
tions of those original and permanent particles ?—See
on this subject our poet’s observations in ver. 980,
and following.

Ver. 774. Thus sung Emmocms, &c.] Empedo-
cles was the scholar both of Pythagoras and Anaxa-
goras. He was, likewise, contemporary with Euri·
pides the poet, and of course flourished in the 84th
olympiad, about four hundred years before the
Christian era. That he had imbibed the sentiments
here attributed to him, in common indeed with Py. .
thagoras, and Ocellus Lucanus, Ovid informs us in
his Metamorphoses,

Qatuor aeternus genitalia corpora mundus
Continet.
For this eternal world is said of old
But four prolific principles to hold.

Plutarch, however, has more fully recognised
him still. Εμπεδοκλες Μετονος Αγροιγαντινος, *rso-0⁵92

Agrigentum maintained, that all things are pro-
duced from the principles of fire, air, water and earth ς
into which they are all again eventually resolved.’'
To these he added two other powers, Love and Dis-
cord ; the former harmonizing and uniting, the latter

disjoining, and repelling. Empedocles is reported
