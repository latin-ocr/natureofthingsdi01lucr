DE ΗΕΒ UM NATURA.

Lm. 11-

Scire licet, quam sint nullo velata colore.

Qualis enim eaecis poterit color esse tenebris,

Lumine qui in ipso mutatur, propterea quod,

Recta aut obliqua percussus luce, refulget ?

Pluma columbarum quo pacto in* sole videtur,

Ver. 809. Hues born qs sun-beams, ] Pindar is
as correct in his philosophy, as he is elegant in his
poetry‚ in the expression :

 

παμπορφορους ακτινας. ΟΒΕ vi.

the purple beams of light.

Nor ought we to forget the appropriate and beauti,
ful address of Cowley to Light, in his celebrated
hymn on this subject ε

All the world’s bravery that delights our eyes,
Is but thy several liveries :

Thou the rich dye on them bestow'st.

Thy pencil paints this landscape as thou go’st.
A crimson gai-ment in the rose thou wear’st‚
A crown of studded gold thou bear’st.

The virgin linies, in their white,

Are clad bul with the lawa ⁰f almost nabal light.

Eut nothing, either in Greek or Persian poet1·y‚
can surpass that very elegant figure of Gray's :

The bloom of young desire, and pzttple light of love.

In which he appears to have used the term purple,
not in the modern and coum-acted sense of this ex-
pression, as confined to a single hue, but in the more
extensive meaning with which it was applied by all
ancient poets to every object highly beautiful and de-
licate, be its colour whatever it might. Whence Ca-
tullus applies it to the leaves of the oak: quercus
ramos purpureos3 and Albinovanus, even to the snow
itself, nivrm purpureum.

Whilst I am upon this subject, I cannot avoid
noticing‚ that this much-admired verse of Gray’s is
not altogether so original as it is generally conceived
to be. Tasso has the very same idea in his Jerusalem
Delivered z

Gli empie d’onor la faccia, e vi riduce
Di giovinezza il bel purpureo lame.

Yet Tasso himself was not the inventor of it. For
we thus trace it, verbatim, in Vin-gil, who applies it

to AEneaS‚ as Tasso does to Godfrey :

 

lumenque juventa
Pur-smmum, et laetos oculis afflarat honores.

L. i. 594.

The sprightly grace and purple light qs youth
⁷ Beam'd from his eyes.

The term purple, in all these instances‚ refers obvi-
ously to its original and more extensive meaning of
magnificent, superb, or beautiful. It is in this sense
Milton himself appears to have used it, in a passage
strikingly parallel :

Here love his golden shafts employs‚ here lights
His constant lamp, and waves his purple wings.
PAR. Les-r,

Ver. 811. Thus the gay phlgeon, as his plumes he
waves,

Drinks In new tinctum from the noan -tide blaze:]

So the truly Classical Gray‚ in his “ Bard :”

 

and, soaring as she sings,
VVaves in the eye of heaven her many-eolour’d
wings.

The whole 'description is thus beautifuuy and
closely copied by Tasso:

Cosi piuma talor, che di gentile
Amomsa, colomba il eollo cinge,
Mai non si scorge a se stessa simile ;
Ma in diversi colori al sol si tinge.
Or d'accesi rubin sembra un monile z
Or di verdi smeraldi il lumefinge .-
Or insieme gli mesce: e varia, e vaga,
In cento modi, i rignardanti appaga.
Gnizus. Cant. xv. 5.
