BooK II. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 341

To every mode of motion, rashly oft,
Oft vain and fruitless, till, at length, it form’d

Th' unchanging rudiments of things sublime,

And heav⁷n, and earth, and main, and mortals rose :—— 107 5

Hence doubly fiows it, other systems still,

Like ours, must deck the vast etherial void,

Enfolded in its avaricious grasp.

Ample, moreo’er‚ the matter thus requir'd,

The place at hand, the cause efficient full, 1080

Whence new creations may for ever spring.

Since, then, so boundless the great mass of seeds

That endless ages ne’er could cast th’ amount,—

Since the same pow’r presides, the nature still

That rear’d this visual system, and alike 108 5

Those seeds can mould to systems such as ours—

The fact fiows doubtless, mid the void immense,

That other worlds in other parts must rise,

Peopled with reas'ning‚ and with bruta] tribes.

Add, too, that nought, through universal space, 1090

basis: from such a propensity arises every motion
perceived in heavenly or in terrestrial bodies. It is a
disposition to be attracted, which taught hard steel to
rush from its place, and rivet itself on the magnet;
it is the same disposition which impels the light straw
to attach itself firmly on amber: it is this quality
which gives every substance in nature a tendency
toward another, and an inclination forcibly directed
to a determinate point.’' These notioris, as the im-
mortal president observes, are “ vague indeed, and

unsatisfactory :¹³ but there is a truth and sublimity
in them, and a parallelism with the theories of Kepler
and Newton, which cannot but be astonishing to
every one. The books, however, that contain the
richest magazine of Indian astronomic knowledge are
the Surya Siddhmzta3 the treatise of Parmam on
the first age of Indian science, that of Varaha for the
middle, and those osBhascara for times comparativcly
modern.
