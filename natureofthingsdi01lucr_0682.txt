Lm. III.

Currit, agens mannos, ad vil-lam praecipitanter,

Auxilium tectis quasi ferre ardentibus instans:

Oseitat ex templo, tetigit quom limina villae3

Aut abit in somnum gravis, atque oblivia quaerlt:

Aut etiam properans urbem petit, atque revisit.

Hoe se quisque modo fugit: at, quem scilicet, ut fit,

chugere haud potis est, ingratiis haeret, et obit3

Propterea, morbi quia caussam non tenet aeger:

Quam bene si videat, jam rebus quisque relictis

Naturam primum studeat cognoscere rerum 3

taken the meaning of his author in this passage, and,
therefore, instead of sending thc restless mortal‚ whom
Lucretius describes, into the country, to extinguish
the flames of his villa on fire, he represents him as
flying away from his father's house in town, for the
sole reason, that it was on fire : nor does the term sa-

As if their father-’s house vvere all 'on fire,
To their small farm.

The luxury of the Romans did not equal, at the
time'of Lucretius, that which was evinced a century
afterwards ; but it may be questioned, whether it did

- not even then cqual that of the present day in any
part of modern Europe. With more than Oriental
indulgence, they partook of all their principal meals

in a recumbent position ; and, although the poet has
not made mention of the couch, or reposing seat on
which they theu lay at ease, the fact of yawning,
indulging sleep, and secking obliviosi, obviously
proves that he refers to it. And I know of no bet-
ter word by which to express this luxurious contriv-
ance, than the modern term sofa, which it very
much resembled 3 not immediately, perhaps, in its
form, but in its use and powers; for the guest that
recliued on a dining couch that admitted but himself
alone, lay always at full length, supporting his head
or the upper part ofhis body, with his left hand ς and
where this couch was large enough to admit of more
than oue person, an abundance of pillowsqwere sup-
plied to administer to the ease of each. Like the mo-
dern sofa, moreover, the dining couch of the Romans
was liued and covered with the softest, and most or-
namenta] stuffs or silks. Virgil has given us a rich
and appropriate description of this species of furniture
of the Roman dining room, in his account ofthe first
feast prepared by Dido for AEneas and his suite,
which he represents after the Roman cestu-ine :
