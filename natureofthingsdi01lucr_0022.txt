viii PREFACR

NATURE or 'rumas is prefixed a life of its author, drawn up from
the materials already furnished him by Ciunta, Le Blanc, Hubert
Giffane, Lambine, and other commentators upon the poem: and to
every book is appended a small body of notes, many of which show
him to have been better acquainted with his subject than de Ma-
rolles. As a translator, however, he has succeeded less than as an ex-
positor. His version is prolix and paraphrastic, inelegant, and de-
void of spirit. It, nevertheless‚ obtained a second edition in 1692 ;
and a third in 1708, but without any material alterations in either.
De Coutures was succeeded in his attempt by Alexander Deleyre,
who is well known as one of the writers of the Encyclopedie‚ but still
more SO, as the author of a translation of Lord Verulam’s philosophie
treatises. Deleyre died in 1797, and left this version among several
other inedited works. It has not yet been pubhshed, nor is it much
entitled to such a distinction, if not superior to his metrical romances
set to music by his friend Jean Jaques Rousseau. Deleyre was, in
all probability, well acquainted with the Epicurean hypothesiS‚ but
lie possessed little of the fire of ,genuine poetry. He may have been
'a well-meaning man, but he was, in the early part of his life, a rigid
Jesuit, and in the latter, a morose philosopher.

Be the merit of the manuscript version of Deleyre, however, what
it may, the necessity of its publication is now altogether superseded
by the very elegant translation, in French verse, of M. Le Blanc de
Guillet, which was neatly printed at Paris in two volumes octavo, in
1783÷÷÷‚ and dedicated to M. Dionis du Sejour3 and perhaps, by its
appearance and intrinsie merit, first of all induced Deleyre to relin-
quish his design. The version is accompanied with the original text

²* Ι have also seen a work which pretends to be a translation of the Narona or Tamus, and which
was published at Amsterdam‚ in French prose, about twenty years ago. It is an anonymous performance,
and rather an abridgement of the poem than a full version. Its size is small octavo, and it entitles itself
‘Traduction Libre.
