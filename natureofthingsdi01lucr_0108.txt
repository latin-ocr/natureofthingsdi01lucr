xciv THE LIFE OF LUCRETIUS,

of 311 ardour and enthusiasm which would have become a priest 3 and
it 1135 hence been inquired what could be so absurd 35 to rccommend
piety, ancl engage in devotional exercises, if the soul be not immor*-
tal, if there bc no resurrection of the body, and the Deity interfere
not with moral actions lest the human will be curtailed in its liberty ?
This question has been proposed ostem and the adversaries of Epi-
curus have maliciously replied to it, that he was only influenced to
such a conduct by a fear of offending the civil power. It is im-
possible, however, to form a more false conjecture of his motives‚ nor
can any one give credit to such reply for an instant, who is acquainted
with the magnanimity he evinced throughout every stage of his life;
the fortitude with which he opposed the prevailing superstitious of the
people, and the simplicity of his own religious tenets. “ We are ac-
customed,’' observes Gasscndi, upon this very point, “to assign two
causes why mankind should worship the Deity: the one is, his own
excellent and supreme nature; and the other, the benefits he is con-
tinually conferring upon us by restraining us from evil, or vouchsafing
to us some positive good ·†·.'’ It was then, by the former, and the far
purer of these motives, by which Epicurus was actuatcd. Seneca, in-
deed, expressly tells us so : “ Hc worshiped God,” says 116, “ induced
by no hope, by no reward, but 011 account of his most excellent Ma-
jesty, and Supreme Nature alone †.” ‘⁶ And why should we not,‘'' iu-
quires Bayl‘e, “ allow to Epicurus the idea of 3. worship which our
most orthodox theologians recommend as the most legitimam and tho
most perfect? For they preach to us, from day to day, that though
there should be no paradise to hope for, and no hell to dread, we
should, never-theless, be obliged to honour God, and to do whatever
