DE RERUM NATURA.

Lxss. 11.

Ingratos animos, atque inpia pectora volgi

Conterrere metu quae possint numine divae.

Ergo, quom primum, magnas invecta per urbeis,

Munificat tacita mortaleis muta salute:

AEre atque argento sternunt iter omne viarum,

Largificit stipe ditante83 ninguuntque rosarum

Floribus, umbrantes hlatrem, comitumque catervam.

Heic armata manus, Curetas nomine Graecei

Quos memorant Phrygios, inter se sorte catervis

of the tarantula, if, in reality, music have any effect
upon this disease at all,--of which the celebrated
Neapolitan professor Cir-illo has much doubted, but
which is supported by the concurrent testimony of
Redi, Mead, and Fontana,—is performed in the same
mechanical way. Like opium, the poison of the ta-
rantula is found to produce a very considerable dispo-
sition to stupor and apoplexy. Strong, nervous sti-
mulams, continued till the violence of their influence
have subsided, must, in both cases, therefore, be highly
rational and beneficiah and it is notat all impro-
bable, in persons more especially of irritable constitu-
tions, that musical tones upon a key, adapted to the
peculiar genus of their nervous system, and inces-
santly persevered in, may protract life, whether ac-
companied with dancing, or not, but especially in
the latter case, till the extraneous and morbid matter
have ceased to operate, and be entirely discharged
through some of the emunctories of the body.
Quere, Is it altogether irrational to employ such a
stimulus in the desperate case of canine madness?
But in diseases strictly mental, the powers of the
melopoea might, I think, be more advantageously
studied and made use of, than in any other class of
disorders whatever ς aad upon which, indeed, it

might operate by its own sympathetic influenee.
Alexander, Scipio, Saul, the attendants on Orpheus,
or the Mater Idaea of Lucretius, are not the only
persons of whom we have credible reports, that their
passions were either maddened or sobered by different
applications of different musical powers. Niewentyt
and South, in modern times, make mention of simi-
lar facts. Eric, king of Denmark, is reported to
have been roused, at all times, to the most furious
acm, by the performance of certain compositions of
a musician, whom he pensioned. And Boyle, who
has professedly written on this subject, relates the
case of a woman, who could never avoid shedding
tems, as also that of a man, who could never retain
his mine, upon the persor-mance of particular tuneS,
symphoneous with their respective constitutions-

But it is not the music of the times, but the man-
ners also that have changed, and hercby rendered the
above, and similar effects‚ much less frequent than
might otherwise have been expected, even allowing
that the most scientific attention had been paid to
sympathetic melody. The simpler the sphere of life
in which mankind move, unquestionably the stronger
the passions to which they are subjected. Whether
the exet-eise of such violent passions be more or less
