Reflect, moreo'er, how less than nought to us 1010
Weighs the long portion of eternal time
Fled ere our birth: so, too, the future weighs
When death dissolves us. What of horror, then,
Dwells there in death? what gloomy, what austere Ρ
Can there be elsewhere slumber half so souncl Ρ 101 5
The tales of hell exist not in the grave,

But here, and curse us living. TANTALUS,

lated: the more general fable assera, that he was
placed in the river Eridanus, with his head alone
raised above the water, and perpetually tormented
with hunger and thirst ; both which appetites he was
precluded from grafifying, notwithstanding that the
tip of his tongue was suffered to touch the water in
which he was immersed, and that a large quantity of
tempting apples were hung immediately around his
head. It is to this fable Horace refers, in the fol-

lowing lines :

De plus affreux transports, des plus noirs fureur's
J’ai trouve la terre agitEe ;
Eue est fertile en successeurs

De Titye et de Promethee,
Les Tantales, les Ixions

Ont inonde vote patrie ;
Et l’empire de flots a bien moins de furie

Que le regne des passivus.

Of hideous joys, and furies fell,

According to the mythology of the Greeks, Tanta-

was also king of Phrygia, and grandfather of Aga-
memnon and Menelaus. It is fabulously reported of
him, that, on some signal occasion, he inxited the
gods to an entertainment; and, to prove their pre-
