BooK 1. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 103

Thus seeds are simple solidS‚ form'd compact
Of points extreme, that never can recede: 660 “
Not lab’ring jointly to produce some end,

But potent from simplicity alone,

And hence eternal ε equally unprone

To waste or sever3 and by nature kept

To feed the* suffering fabric of the world. ν 665
Did no such points exist, extreme and least,

Each smallest atom would be, then, combin'd

Of parts all infinite3 for every part

Parts still would boast, dividing without end.

And, say, what difference could there, then, subsist 670

’Twixt large, and small? for tho' th’ ENTIRE OF THINGS

Should infinite be deem'd, each smallest speck

Still parts as infinite would hold embrac⁷d.

But since at this the reasoning mind revolts‚

Then must it own, o'erpower'd‚ that points exist 675

Least by their nature, and of parts devoid :

And solid, hence, and of eternal date.

Hence seeds arise, the last, least parts conceiv'd
Of actual being: the extreniest points
To which creative nature all resolves. 680
Which, if not least, if still of parts possest,

Could ne’er, with close exactitude, renew

The universal frame ε all, all would rise
