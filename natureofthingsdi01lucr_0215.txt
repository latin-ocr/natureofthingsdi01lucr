Boon 1. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 67

From human sight remov’d‚ by all confess’d

Alike materia13 since alike the sense

They touch impulsive3 and since nought can touch 34 5

But matter3 or, in turn, be touch'd itself.

Thus, too, the garment that along the shore,

Lash'd by the main, imbibes the briny dew,

Dries in the sun-beam: but, alike unseen,

F alls the moist ether, or again flies off 350

Entire‚ abhorrent of the red-ey’d noon.

So fine th’ attenuated spray that floats

In the pure breeze3 so fugitive to sight.

A thousand proofs spring up. The ring that deeks

The fair one’s finger, by revolving years, q 355

Wastes imperceptibly. The dropping show'r

Scoops the rough rock. The plough’s attemper’d share

The tumbling torrent scoops the rugged mck ;

poem, entitled Crombe Ellen, by the Rev. M. Bowles,

Thestern steel plough-share wastes beneath its toil; who has often favoured the world with proofs of

And the gold ring the finger that adorns
Lessens by friction.

The same series of {mages is adopted by Ovid,
with a triffing inversion of the order:

Gutta cavat lapidem, consumitur annulus usu
Et ten'tur pressa vomer aduncus humo.

Pou’r. iv. 10.

Drops scoop the stone, much use the ring consumes,
And the curved share attenuates in the glebe.

Of these examples, that of Bion's is by far the most
beautiful, as containing a moral reference. On which
account, aisn, the following, which is the productiori
of a poet of the present day, cannot be perused with-
out a strong feeling of intrinsie merit. It occurs in a

truly poetic inspiration.

Scenes of retir'd sublimity that fill

With fearful extacy‚ and holy trance,

The pausing mind l—-we leave your awfnl gloom.
And lo! the footway plank that leads across
The narrow torrent, foaming thro’ the chasm
Below ; the rugged stones ure wash'd and worn
Into a thousand shapes, and hollows, scoop'd

By long attrition of the ceascless surge,

Smooth, deep, and polish'd as the marble urn,

In their hard forms. Here let us sit and walch
The struggling current burst its headlong way,
Hearing the noise it makeS‚ and musing much
On the strange changes of this nether world, Sec.
