THE LIFE OF LUCRETIUS. lxi

ther asleep or awake, slialt thou be. oppresscd- with anxicty, but live

as a God among mankind Ψ

If then, it be inquired, whence such unjust accusations could hare
arisen against a sect, that so little deserved thern, Du Rondelle, who
has investigated this matter with much critical penetration, shall in-
form us. “ To hear such a man as EpicuruS‚''' says lie, “ was a pl'ea-
sure, not often to be met with. For, instrueted in the opinions of
all the philosophers, endowed with a quick conception, possessed of
great eloquence, nor evei· opening his lips without dignity, in a most
delightful garden, decorated with a variety of fragrant flowers that
pertumed the aii· with their odours, he arrested the attention of every
one with more than Herculean chains; whence Laertius compares
him to the Sirens3 nor was it possible for an auditor to quit this de—
lightful spot, without feeling the bonds of friendsliip for a host who
was equally successful in his researches, and enchanting in his diction.
Τ he mode of philosophizing which he adopted, was highly approved
of. Its report spread over all Athens, and was in the mouth of every
one: from every quai-ter visitors thronged to our philosopher, and
were anxious to intermix in his audience3 while the professors of other
systems were deserted, and themselves left alone in their schools.

“ This displeased the philosophers, but more especially the Stoics :
and as Diotimus, one of the latter sect, had already discovered impu-
dence enough to defame whomsoever he chose, he was applied to, to
write against Epicurus They now burst forth, therefore, with fifty

lascivious epistles, pretended to have been written by the philosopher
