In reality‚ the two doctrines here referred to, of
the origin of man from the sun, or the etherial hea-
vens, and from water, are parts of an almost universal
mythology, and form two of the grand pivots on
which nearly every system of ancient idolatry ap·

words.

It has been the object of Mr. Bryant's literary
labour5‚ to trace these doctrines to their fountain-
head 3 and though his system seems, in many places,
to require foundation, and to be too extravagant in
its etymologieS, it applies so ingeniously‚ both to the
records and traditionsofthemost ancient times,andis so
truly comprehensive and pertinent, that the reader
will perhaps thank me for offer-ing, in the present
place, some analysis of it, as since enlarged and at-
tempted to be confirmed by other writers.

These gentlemen begin with supposing, that the
mythology of all nations, ancient or modern, ascends
no higher than the period of the deiuge3 and that,
whatever conceptione, the Pagan world-may have en-
tertained of an ante-diluvian existence, such as those
of a paradise, and a golden age, such conceptions are
little more than mere isolated traditions, unconnecttd
with the mythologie systems which were afterwards
invented and multiplied.
upon this theory, that the first object ofidolatrous dei-
fication after the (hod, was the sun ; that every species
of Pagan theology has originated from solar worship ς

It is generally conjectured,

and that the name of almost every deity aud fabulous
hero ofthe Oriental world, as well as of those imported
thence into Greece, is referahle to the sun himself, or
to some rite or ceremony appertaining to solar wor-
ship. Such is the conjecture gentrrilly entertained
upon this theory, and which was contended for by Mr.
Bryant himself: but there are others of trie same
> school, who do not contemplate the worship of the sun
ns the rnost ancient species of idolatry, nor that from
which every mythologie fal-,le has originated. The
mythology of the whole Pagan world is, by such in-
quirers, resolvcd into three grand systems of idolatry,

each of nearly equal date, aud all intertwining and
combining with each other in every possibility of va-
riety—the worship of the Ark-the worship of the
Serpent‚—and the worship of the Suu. Of these, the
Arkite idolatry is conceived to be‚·in some measure,
the most ancient ; then the institution of Serpent
or Ophite worship 3 and lastly, that of the Sun.

On the fall of the flood, and the resting of the ark
upon mount Ararat, the vessel that had preserved the
sui-vivors of the human race from the destruction
that prevailed around them, and the patriarch who
had contrived and guided this wonderful machine over
the shoreless ocean, were at first contemplated with
gratitude and reverence: and when idolatry‚ or the
worship of sensible images began, in a generation or
two afterwards, to supersede the pure and spiritual
worship of the Creator, both were deified, and the
system of arkite idolatry commeneed. Noah was
regarded as a god, and the vessel in whose capacious
womb the patriarch himself, with his family, and all
that appertained to his family, was preserved, as a
goddess, and the common parent of au things.
Hence the origin of the fable of Venus, or the com·
mon parent of all things, rising from the flood ;
hence she acquired the name of Δημητης, (Dcnzeter‚)

or, according to the Chaldeam, Da-Mater, which is

literally ‘⁵ the Mother’ of Gods and men3 a term,
undoubtedly, long afterwards applied, under anoflier
system, both to Ceres and the Earth, bnt which, on
its first invention, was the peculiar appellation of
Venus, or the Egyptian Aphrodite. From the same
historic fact we trace, too, t'ne origin of the fable of
the great mundane egg floating on the surface of the
mighty waters‚ and containing, within itself, the ru-
diments of the future world. Hence, again, the ori-
gin of the worship of Isis and Osiris, and the ccre-
mony among the Egyptians of the mystical enshrine-
ment of the latter, a mere personification of Noah, in
an ark or vessel, which was conveyed twice a year
with great pomp and splen-dour through the public
streets, and amidst the ador-ing multitude, under the

name of the former. Hence, the Xuth‚ zaab, ox·
