THE LIFE OF LUCRETIUS. ciii

tending factiuns of his country. He had been on ternis of alliancc with
Caesar and Anthony, while the most intimate friend of Cassius and
Brutus :—yet Anthony, upon the present occasion, readily resigned
him, at the solicitation of his two colleagues: and hence liis name was
also in the list of the proscribed. On the first surmisc of this villany,
that unrivalled presence of mind, for which he had ever been remark-
able, proved again of essential service to him. The object of Atticus,
who was at this time in Rome, was, like that 01³ the two Ciceros, to
reach either Macedonia or Sicily; but he pur-sned a different plan to
accomplish it : and the stratagem he invented succecded according to
its merit. He attired himself, without loss of time, in the habit οἰδ,
Roman praetor, and disguised the slaves whom he selected to accom-
pany him in the dress of attendant lictors. He left the city with all
possible speed, travelled in the most public manner, and invented a
story, to give plausibility to his journey, that he was sent by the tri-
umvirs themselves to negotiate a peace with young VPmnpey. In this
manner he was received in every city through which he passed with
all possible marks of distinction, accommodated with horses, provi—
sions, and every assistance he required—travelled entirely at the pub-
lic expence, and arrived at Sicily in perfect safety. In this retreat he
continued quiet and unmolested, till the political tempest ofhis coun—
try had discharged itself of its fury. He then returned to Rome, at
the particular request of Augustus, and continued in possession of the
esteem both of himself, and Agrippa, till his death; which, neverthe-
less, was not long afterwards effected by his own hands: extreme grief,
in all probability, for the loss of his earlier companions and friends,
having compelled him to a step which was common among the wisest
and most virtuous of the heathcn world3 and regarded rather as an act
of duty and heroism, than of criminality and disgrace.
