THE NATURE OF THINGS.

Pervious and rare 3 while those so solid form'd

No force create can sever, or dissolve.

Nor deem such solids doubtful ε though so deem’d

That sound, that munder, that the voice itself

Breaks thro' domestic walls t that rigid steel

Admits the blaze, and whitens: vitreous rocks

Berkley οι· Hume, seem to have been influenced by
a similar train of reasoning, and probably the scep-
ticism of the Pyrrhonie school was founded upon the
discrepant and incongruous maxims of Pythagoras,
Plato, and Aristotle, respecting the corpuscles of

of such sizes, figureS, and with such other pro-
perties, and in such proportion to space, as most
conduced to the end for which he formed them.-
And that these primitive particles, being solid,
are incomparably harder than any porous body com-

matter; the first contending that they are infinitely pounded <ff them: even so very hard as never to

divisible, and of course terminate at last in absolute
nullity; and the other two, that, intrinsically, they
are destitute of quantity, quality, extent, or figure, and
consequently that they are equally null and non-exist-
ent. The Sceptics,therefore,like the IdealistS,thought
it necessary to prove the existence of an external
world, but, like the latter, they failed, and of course
doubted of every thing. The lesson we should hence
deduce is, that it is impossible to philosophise with-
out a basis of first principles3 that the utmost cir-
cumspection is necessary in the choice we make of
them; and that, when once adopted, they should,
on no account, be departed from.

Compare this with the doctrine of Sir Isaac New-
t0n3 and it must be confest that even this philoso-
ph‘er has been more indebted to the school of Epicu-
curus, than is generally conceived. I will quote his
own words: “ All things considered, it seems pro-
bable, that God, in the beginning, formed matter in
solid, massy, hard, impenetrable, moveable particles 3

wear and break in pieces ; no ordinary power being
able to divide what God himself made one in the
first creation.’'

Sir Isaac Newton found these opinions indeed, but
he built upon* them, and a most noble superstructure
has he raised. To him are we indebted for the doc-
trines of attraction and repulsion, and the laws which
govern and regulate the Universe. Matter with him,
though primitively consisting of solid impenetrable
parficles, is not eternal‚ though apparently indisso-
luble : it is a created substance, and speaks and proves
the existence of an immaterial and intelligent au-
thor.

Des Cartes, however, as he differed from our unri-
valled countryman in his doctrine ofa vacuum, differed
likewise from him in almost every other idea respect-
ing matter itself, excepting indeed as to its creation
hythe Deity. According to Des Cartes, therefore,
matter was possessed of no such primitive particles as
those imagined by Newton and the Epicureans ; un—
der every modification it was totally unsolid and infi—
nitely divisible: a doctrine which occupies the whole
of the fourth book of the Cartesian Anti-Lu>
