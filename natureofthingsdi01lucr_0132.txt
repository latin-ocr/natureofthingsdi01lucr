ternately to have fallen. In effect, both the ethics 0³f the Epicuream,
which were only studied in the uncandid and deceitsul narratives of
hostile writers, and the whole range of their physical system, which
denied all particular interference of Providence, the immortality of the
soul, and a state of future resurrection,—till considerably explained
and modified, were sufficient to excite alarin, and justify indignation.
It was, for a similar reason, that Aristotle himself was, for a long pe-
riod, anathematized3 his doctrine of the eternity of the world being
conceived an essential part of his entire system. Origen, indeed, who
bcheld in the eclectio chaos an attempt to unite the schools of Aristo-
tle and Plato, seems to have conjectured that a similar coalition
might advantageously have been produced between Peripatetism and
Christianity; but this conjecture appears rather to have tcrminated in
a simple wish, than in any actual effort ᾖ. Hence, Justin Martyr,
Tanau, Irenaeus, Clemens ofAlexandria, Eusebius, and almost all the
most learned defenders of the Christian saith, wh‘o flourished during
its first six centurieS, discover a strange propensity to a variety of Pla-
tonic and Pythagoric doctrines, bnt especially to the former, even
while they openly and honestly oppose the grosser absurdities· towards
which they tended. St, Austin asserts expressly, that he was prepared
for the reception of Christianity by a perusal of the writings of the
later Platonists† ; and in many of the hymns of Synesius, bishop of
Ptolemais, which have yet survived their author, we trace much more
of Cabbalism, Gnosticism, Platonism, and Peripatetism, than of the
pure precepts of the gospel he professed ᾗ.

Yet, though the school of Aristotle was thus generally abandoned
by the learned Fathers of the Christian chnrch, it was by no means
