xliv THE LIFE OF LUCRETIUS.

rather than upon the poet; for Ι hesitale not to assert, that throughout
the whole it is impossible for order to be more luminous, for language
to be inore perspicacioris, or for the greater part of the deductions in-
troduced to be inore consequent and legitimam. There are few prose
writers upon mathematieal and metaphysical subjects so felicitous in
the conveyance os their ideas t—-and, as to most of the translators and
Commentators upon the Latin text, I have often been compelled to
turn to the original to discover what they were endeavonring to inter-
pret. Added to which, thetoccasional digressions, in which the poet
has indulged himself, flow freely, and to the point; and his episodes
are altogether unrivalled. Ι am not smprised, therefore, at the en-
thusiasm which Quintus Cicero, who through life adhered to the sys-

ling companion ainidst his wars ; and, like Alexander, with respect to
the Iliad, or, as is reported, Bonaparte, with respect to the poems of
Ossian—he slept with it under his pillow, and feasted on it whenever
he had leisure. Nor did he estimate its merits too highly: for Mar-
cus Cicero himself, long after he had abjnred the doctrines it is de-
signed to elucidate, accedes, in one of his letters to his brother, to
his own exalted opinion of it: ‘⁶ I agree with you,'’ says he, “ that
this poem displays a large and luminous mind, and many masterly
touches of the poetic art *3⁹ This, however, is not the only instance
in which Marcus Cicero testified his high sense of Lucretius as a
poet. We shall find, in the prosecution of this narrative, that we are
indebted to him for its publication. And when, several years after-
wards, Cytheris recited the Silenus of Virgil before a ful] audience‚
Cicero, who was present on the occasion, enraptured with its beauti—
sul epitome of the Epicurean philosophy, burst suddenly into an
extatic exclamation, that its author was “a SECOND hope of mighty
