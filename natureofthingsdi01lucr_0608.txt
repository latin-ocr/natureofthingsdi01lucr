DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. ΙΙΙ.

Si non certa loca ad nascundum reddita quoique

Sunt, et ubei quidquid possit durare creatum ;

Atque ita, multimodis, pro totis artubus, esse3

Membrorum ut nusquam exsistat praeposterus ordo?

Usque adeo sequitur res rem, neque flamma creari

Fluminibus solita est, neque in igni gignier algor.

Praeterea, si inmortalis natura animai· est,

Et sentire potest, secreta a corpore nostro;

625

Quinque, ut opinor, eam faciundum est sensibus auctam:

Nec ratione alia nosmet proponere nobis

Possumus infernas animas Acherunte vagare.

Pictores itaque, et scriptorum secla priora,

Sic animas introduxerunt sensibus auctas,

a more proper term than dews or auras. I will quote,
then, the original to prove there is nothing to justify
such an idea ε

Cedit item retro de terra, quod fuit ante,
In terras ; et quod missum est cx etheris 0r1's,
Id rursum coeli relatum templa receptant.

He first mistakes the meaning of Lucretius by
pretending, that he asserts souls or spirits, instead
of dews or gasses, to be transmitted from heaven,
and afterwards retumed there; and having com-
mittcd this blunder, he next avers that our poet
contradicts himself upon this doctrine, by contend-
ing, that the soniis created in the bosom, and can-
not exist elsewhere. But he brings Lactantius to
corroborate this supposed contradiction, who, it
must be confessed, has been unaccountably seduccd
into the same mistake, and by whose authority, it
is probable, that the commentator was himself de·
ceived. Veritate‚ says Lactantius, victus est, et
imprudenti ratio vera surrepsit. Lacr. l. vii. c. xii.

de Div. Praem. “ Lucretius is convicted by the
truth itself, which has escaped from him unawares.'’
But Bayle has justly observed upon the very verses
in question, that, ceux qni pretendent qu'il n'a pu
parler de la sorte sans se contredire, n'avoient gueres
compris ses sentimens. Art. Luci-ece: “ those who
assert that he could not speak in this manner with-
out contradicting himself, have never understood his
opinions.''

Lactantius, however, has not been followed by
the commentator upon Creech alone, but by a vari-
ety of other men of letters who have chosen, as im-
phcidy, to depend upon his interpretation. Thus,
in a letter from a celebrated Dominican friar to the
president of the company of Jesuits, written ex-
pressly on the subject of Chinese Idolatry, we find the
solim-:ing observation : ¹‘ Ce ne seruit pas une chose
sui-prenanfe que les Chinois se contredissent eux-
meines, puisque Lucrece, l'un des plus scavans phi-
Iosophes de la secte des Epicuriens, qui osa combattre
