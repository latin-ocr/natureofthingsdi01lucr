DE RERUM NATURA„

Lis. ΙΙ.

Quae sita cervices circum collumque coronat.

Namque ali& fit, utei claro sit rubra pyropo3

Interdum quodam sensu fit, utei videatur

Inter curalium virideis miscere smaragdos,

Caudaque pavonis, larg& quom luce repleta est,

Consimili mutat ratione obvorsa colores:

Quei quoniam quodam gignuntur luminis ictu,

Scire licet, sine eo fieri non posse putandum.

Et, quoniam plagae quoddam genus excipit in se

The vivid green his shining plumes unfold,
His painted wings‚ and breast that flames with gold.

Without wandering from the subject, the reader
may, with this, compare the following description of

Mr. Mason ε

 

supreme in glittering state

The peacock spreads his rain—bow train, with eyes
Of sapphire bright‚ irradiate each with gold:
Meanwhile, from every spi-ay, the ring-doves coo.
Enemsn GARDEN.

These admirable verses cannot but remind the

Portuguese reader of a similar description of Carnoens,
in his Lusiad :

Olha de Banda as llhas, que se esmaltao
Da varia cor que pinta o roxo fruto

As ares variadas que ali saltao

Da verde noz tornando seu tributo.

Here Banda’s isles their fair embroid‘ry spread

Os various fruitage‚ azure, white, and red ;

And birds of every beauteous plume display

Their glitt'ring radiance, as from spray to spray,

From bower to bower on busy wings they rov'e‚

To seize the tribute of the spicy grove.

There is a bold and energetic illustration of this
same phrenomenon, of the intermixture and conversion
ofthe solar hues, in Mr. Cumberland’s Calvary‚ derived
from a very different quarter 3 and which I shall in-

troduce by way of contrast. Satan is represented as
having received the annunciation of his final doom
from our Saviour; his whole figure is immediately
changed ; and even the attendant demon Mammon,

 

in ghastly silence stood,

Gazing with horror on his chieftain’s face,

‘That chang’d all hues byflls ς as when the north,
With nitrous vapours charg’d, convulsive shoots
Its fiery darts athwart the trembling pole,
Making heaven’s vault a canopy of blood.

So, o'er the visage of th’ exorcis’d flend
Alternate gleams, like metc’ors, came and went.

Ver. 819. And as 'the stimulus the sight that strikes]
In the note on ver. 740 1 have already enumerated
the opinions of the principal sects of Grecian philo-
sophers, as to the origin of colours ; and have stated
the resemblance which the theory of Epicurus bears
to that of Sir Isaac Nexvton‚ and which is now al-
most uniformly adopted by philosophers in every
European nation. It is not, however, in the origin
or cause of colours alone that these two sages con-
cur, but also in the mode by which the sight be-
comes sensible of them. It was an axiom, first ad-
vanced by Epicurus, and since nearly universally ac-
quiesced in, that bodies can only operate upon each
other by contact‚ or an approach so near as to an-
swer the purpose of contact: but the coloured sub-
stances we behold, so far from touching our eye8‚
