Boon 111. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 883

Flies all profession, and the fact unfolds.
E’en restless avarice, and love of fame, 60
So oft to deeds unrighteous that seduce,
And spread the growing guilt from man to man,
By ceaseless toil urg’d on, and night and day,
Striving. the croud t’ o'ertop—these pests of life
Draw half their vigour from the dread of death. 65
For infamy, contempt, and want severe,
These chief embitter mortals; these, they deem‚
Death’s foremost tra'1n3 and, studious these to shun,
Far off they Hy, still wand’ring from the right,
Urg’d on by fear, and kindle civil broils, 70
And murder heap on murder, doubling thus,

Ceaseless‚ their stores insatiate: raptur'd high

Thou common vice, thou most contagious ill, -Fifst among these

Bane of the mind, and frenzy of the will l Behold the mighty murderers of mankind :
Thou foe to private, and to public health; They, who in spon-t, whole kingdoms slew, or they
Thou dropsy of the soul, that thirsts for wealth, VVhO, to the tottering pinnacle of pow'r,

Insatiate Av'rice Ξ 'tis from thee we trace Waded through seas of blood ! GLYNN.
The various mis’ry of our morta} race. HAYLEY.
