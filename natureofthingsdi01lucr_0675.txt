THE NATURE OF THINGS. 525

Hence earth itself to fools becomes a hell.

Thus ponder oft, retir'd: ANCUs the good,

E'en he has clos’d his eyes on mortal things 3

1060

A man, thou coward !‘ worthier far than thou 1.

m

¹2⁴] His house, his haunts, his transient tent assail,
And round himflake: qffiery sulphur hail.

16 Below, no stream his blasted root shall bathe ;μ
Above‚ his branches lurid lightnings scathe;

ιγ Clouds heap'd on clouds his memory shall blot 3
His name from earth be banish’d and forgot.

Ver. ¹059·

 

Ancus the good,

E’en he has clos’d his eyes ou mortal things ;]
Festus has observed, that the original of this trans·
lated verse is drawn, with a trifling alteration, from
the poem of Ennius on the Punic war. In Ennius,
we read,

Postquam lumina sis oculis bonus Ancus reliquit.
In Lucretius,

Lumina sissoculis etiam bonus Ancus reliquits

Ver. 1060. E’en he has clos’d his eyes on mortal
thiags5

A man, thou coward J worthierfar than thou J]

The whole of this passage is well translated by

Dryden :
-When thoughts of death disturb thy head,
Consider Ancus great and good> is dead ς

Ancus, thy better far, was born to die,
And thou 1 dost thou bewail mortality ὲ

The Latin of Lucretius is copied from a well-known
distich of Homer ς, and Pope was so delighted
with the above lines of Dryden, that he has employed
them, with but little variation, in his version of the
Greek.. In Homer, they occur thus ε

Αλλοι Φιλος, Sem και συ· rm ολοφυρεαι αυτως ;
Κατθανε κοιι Πατροκλος, ὅσπερ σεο πολλου affatum.
11.. T. 106.

In Pope, as follows z

Die then, my friend ! what boots it to deplere ?
The great, the good Patroclus is no more .'

He, far tliybetter, warsoredaom’d to die,
And thou! dost thou bewail mortalily ?

Ancus Martius was grandson of Numa, and the
fourth of the Roman monarchs. His character is
thus described by Livy : 'Avitae gloriae memor: me-
dium erat in eo ingenium, et Numae et Romuli ς cui-
libet superiorum regum belli, pacisque et artibus,
et gloria par. “ He forgot not the glory of
his ancestors; the powers of his mind were of a
description between those of Numa and Romulus;
and he was equal to any of our former kings in
the glory and arts both of war and peace.’'

The reader will, 1 am confident, readily excuse my
adding in this note, for a comparison with the above
passages of Homer and Lucretius, Ercilla’s descrip-
tion οἱ the death of Lautaro. Lautaro was the most
heroic, as well as most polished, of the Indian chief-
tains: and the manly generosity of Ercilla always
allows him the praise to which he is entitled ε

Ροι· el siniestm lado (o dura suerte !)

Rompe la cruda punta, y tan derecho

Qqe passa el coraqon* mas bravo y suerte

Qnejamas se encerro en humano pecho. Δ

De tal tiro qued& ufana la muerte,

Viendo de solo un golpe tan gran hecho :

Y usurpando la gloria al homicida

Se attribuye 'a la muerte esta herida.

CANT. xiv.
Th'rough his left sides—yet valiant, mourn his
lot !

Flew the keen errem with such fury shot,

It picrc’d his hem-t, the bravest and the best

Tha! e'er was Iadg’d within a human brea-rt.

Proud ofthe stroke that laid such valour low,

Death seem'd to glory in th’ important blow ι

And that no morta! might his triumph claim,

In darkness hid the doubtful archcr’s·name.
