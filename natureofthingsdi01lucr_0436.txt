Vitaleis motus consentire, atque initari.

Sed, ne forte putes animalia sola teneri

Legibus hiis, quaedam ratio disterminat omneis.

Nam, velutci tota natura dissimiles sunt

Inter se genitae res quaeque, ita quomque necesse est

Dissimili constare figura principiorum :

Non, quo multa parum simili sint praedita forma ς

Sed, ‚ quod non volgo paria omnibus omnia constent.

Semina quom porro distent, differre neccsse est

Intervalla, vias, connexus, pondera, plagas,

Ver. 742. But haste we, many a truth lies yet mz-
sung] He proceeds to the developement of
another axiom of the Epicurean philosophy; and
having discussed the substances of bodies, he now
advances to their qualities. He asserts, that the
secondary qualities of all bodies, as colours, sounds,
tastes, odours, and warmth, do not exist in the bodies
themselves, but are only effects produced by the opera-

This important discovery has been generallyattribufed
to the researchcs ofmodern philosophy,in consequence
of the long prevalence of the doctrines of the Pe-
ripatetic school over those of eeeee y other sect, prior
to the triumphs of Des Can-tes and Nevvton3 doc-
trines which spoke very abstrusely and unintelli-

gibly upon secondary qualities in genet-ah but, at
the same time, clearly affirmed, that at least the
quality of colours inhered in the body that was co-
loured, and formed a constituent part of it. We
shall find, however, by a further perusal of the the-
ory and arguments of Lucretius, that modern phi-
losophy, with respect to the qualities of bodies, has
only revived an old and unjustly exploded hypothesis:
and that Newton, Locke, and Boyle, have scarcely
adu-anecd an argument upon the subject that is not
to be met with in the present poem.
