DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. 11.

Suave etiam belli certamina magna tueri ε

Sed nihil dulcius est, bene quam munita tenere,

Edita doctrina sapientum, templa serena ;

Despicere unde queas alios, passimque videre

Errare, atque viam palanteis quaerere vitae3

10

Certare ingenio, contendere nobilitate,

Nocteis atque dies niti praestante labore

Ad summas emergere opes, rerumque potiri.

O miseras hominum menteis! o pectora caeca!

who, from the importance of their station, were not
allowed to be actively engaged in the battle, to mark
its progress from the summit of some neighbouring
hi]1; a post, however, which, from the nature of
modern tactics, would be no longer free from dan-
ger, nor, from the volumes of smoke with which the
combatants are covered, competent to a survey of
what is transacting. It was from a windmill, on
such an eminence as this, that Edward ΙΙΙ. surveyed
the heroic exploits of the Black Princc in the cele-
brated battle of Crescy: and Seneca, in hirs Troas,
has a reference to a similar fact :

Est una magna turris e Troja super
Adsueta Priamo; cujus e fastigio
Summisque pinnis, arbiter belli sedens
Regebat acies: turre in hac, blando sinu
Fovens nepotem, cum metu, versos, gravi,
Danaos fugaret Hector et ferro et face,
Paterna puero bella monstrabat senex.

Sought oft by Priam, swells a spacious tower

High from the Trojan walls; o’er whose bold
eope

VVhose ramparts seated‚ arbiter of fate,

He rul’d tlie fight: here to his fost’ring breast

Straining his grandson, while with fire and sword

Victorious Hector chas’d tli' affrighted Greeks

He show’d the boy where former fields were
fought.

Not widely different, Cicero in the following pas·
sage to Atticus : ⁷

Nunc vero, cum cogar exire de navi, non abjectis,
sed receptis gubernaculis, cupio istorum naufragia

ex terra intueri3 cupio ut ait amicus tuus So-
phocles,

 

και ὑπο wey-q

Πυκνας ακουειν Φεκαδος ἔυδουση Φρενι. Ep. l. ii. 7.
“ But now that Ι arn compelled to quit the vessel

not with lost, but recovered tackle, I wish to be-

hold these shipwrecks from the strand; I wish, as

says thy friend Sophocles,

ι from a cliff to hear
The dashing spray swell frequent o’er the soul-

 

Ver. 7. But sweetcrfar on 'Visdom's heights serene,
To watch the giddy crowd that, deep below,
For ever wander, &c. ] Ovid is under
many obligations to Lucretius; and the following
extract, borrowed from the passage before us, is an
instance in point :

 

 

juvat ire per alta

Astra : juvat, terris et inerti sede relictis,

Nube vehi, validique humeris insistere Atlantis ς
Palentesque animos passim, ac rationis egentes,
Despectam procul. Μετ. xv. 147.

'Tis pleasant mid the stars to soar sublime;
Pleasant‚ from earth, and eanh’s gross region freed,
