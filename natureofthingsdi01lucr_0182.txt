DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. Ι.

Ignoratur enim, ,quae sit natura anima'l‘ ;

Nata sit, an contra nascentibus insinuetur3

Et simul intereat nobis cum, morte dirempta,

115

An tenebras Orci visat, vastasque lacunas ;

An pecudes alias divinitus insinuet se,

Ennius ut noster cecinit, qui primus amoeno

Detulit ex Helicone perenni frunde coronam,

Per genteis Italas hominum quae clara clueret.

The solemn butcheries, that, year by year,
Wait the vext race of Jews, by priests condemn’d,
For stern adherence to their fathers' creed.

Ver. 123. Yet doubfful is the doctrine, and unknown,
&c·] As there is no subject that can be of so much
importance to man as a future existence, there is
none which has more fully occupied the attention
of the meditative and the learned, in every age. The
existence itself‚ the mode of existence, its duration,
or interchange, are points that have been agitated
and discussed in every possible variety of shape.
And what, after all, is the result ?-—that just as much
is now known, by the mere light of reason, as was
known above two thousand years ago, when Lu-
cretius wrote his poem. In effect, although of in-
finite importance, the subject scarcely admits of argu-
mentation of any kind. Of matter, we can discern
but little: of immaterial spirit, nothing at all. We
have no physical data to reason from ; at least, none
that will advance us beyond the bounds of proba-
bility: and every moral consideration is equally as
inconclusive. Hence Cicero, Plato, and many other
sages of antiquity, have expressly declared, that the
more they meditated on this profound subject,the more
their doubts of a future state were increased z while
Democritus, Epicurus, Solomon (as it should seem

from the general tenor of his writings, and especially hig
Ecclesiastes, chap. ii. 15, 16. iii. 18, 19, 20), as well
as the entire body of the Sadducean sect, disbelieved
it altogether. It is an object of revelation, therefore,
rather than of reason ; and a most illustrious object it
is, and completely worthy of the intervention of the
Divinity. And without searching further for motives‚
the Christian philosopher, in the belief of this im-
portant truth alone, finds a dignus vindice nodus, a
motive amply sufficient to justify an immediate com-
munication from the Creator to mankind. See' the
prefixed life of Lucretius.

Ver. 1 2 5. The soulfirst lives, when lives the body first,]
In the prosecution of this poem, which comprises a
complete history of the philosophy of the ancients, 1
shall have frequent occasion to examine the different
systems of opinions that are here enumerated3 and
to compare them with many which have been
started, under the semblance of novelty, in times
much more modern. At present Ι shall content
myself with observing, that the opinion conveyed.
in this, and the preceding line. was that of De· .
mominis, Thales, Epicurus, Empedocles, and a
variety of other sages, who Ansered, neverffidess,
very widely, in many other doctrines of their res-
pective theories.
