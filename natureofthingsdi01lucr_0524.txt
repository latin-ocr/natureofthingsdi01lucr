DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. ΙΠ.

Nam, simul ac ratio tua coepit vociferari

Naturam rerum, divina mente coortam,

Ῑ5

Diffugiunt animi terrores; moenia mundi

Discedunt, totum video per inane geri res:

Adparet divom numen, sedesque quietae 3

Quas neque concutiunt ventei, nec nubila nimbis

’ Adspargunt: neque nix, acri concreta pruina,

20

Cana cadens, violat: semper sine nubibus aether

Integer, et large diffuso lumine, ridit.

Omnia subpeditat porro natura, neque ulla

Ver. 17. F or as the doctrines os thy god-like mind
Prove into birth how nature first uprose,]
Thus rendered by Marchetti z

E non si tosto a sparger cominciossi
Tuo parer : che dagli Dei creata
Le cose nrm sia l'alma natura.

By Creech, as follows:

For when 1 hear thy mighty reasons prove
The world was made without the powers above.

The difference between these versions, and that in
the text, is so obvious and considerable as to render
it necessary foi· me tojustify the change I have in-
troduced. Marchetti and Creech have both followed
the common, but erroneous reading, which runs
thus :

Nam simul ac ratio tua coepit vociferari

Naturam rerum haud divina mente coortam.

The term haud is, unquestionably‚ an interpola-
tion ; it is not to be found in any of the most an—
cient, and correct copies; and is totally incon-
sistent with the plain and obvious sense of the poet
himself. Mr. Wakefield has hence justly discharged
it from its post. The divina mente indubitably re-
fers to Epicurum but some conceited and mistaken
editor, apprehending it applied to an eternal intelli-

openly admit to be the creator of the universe, which
it has been generally, though, in some sense, falsely
conceived he did not admit,-with a most licentious,
and unpardonable use of the pen, attempted, by in-
troducing the negative haud, to make sense of what
is much better sense without it. The ingenious de-
vice, as it was conceived, soon multiplied, and has
hence found its way into the greater number of mo-
dern editions. without repeating in this place
what appears to have been the real creed of Lucre·
tius respecting the existence of a Supreme Intelli-
gence, and primary Creator, I beg leave to refer the
reader to the biography prefixed to the volume be·
‘fore him, and to the notes on Book II. ν. 182, and
v. ι 100. It is from such errors‚ and wilful perver-
sions of the text, as that now undei- consideration,
that Lucretius has often been made to assert propo-
shions, and uphold doctrines, which, in reality, by
no means appertain to his system. In the present
instance, the original meaning is first misconceived 3
—then the text is hardily and unnecessarily trans-
formed, and at last, with idle triumph, advances
a commentator upon this spurious passage, and
declares, that the writer of it hereby assei-ts, che
Epicuro h‘a insegnato la natura non dipendere da
Dio: “that Epicurus taught, the world did not

gent mind, whom, in this case, Lucretius would proceed froni God.'’ Fmeherta Sposstione, Lett. iii.
