And quell the mighty tumult, and recall,

From the rude grasp of fate, each active power

Marshal'd anew, and every sense relume.

For else, why rather should those powers retreat 97 5
Back from destruction with recruited strength,

Than still proceed, and burst the bars of life ?

As pain, too, springs when, midst th' interior frame,
Or limbs extreme, by sudden force convuls’d
Each vital atom shakes through all its course, 980

But yields to pleasure when the shoek subsides,—

Since primal seeds can ne'er such shock sustam,—
No pain they know, nor e'er the fruit can pluck

Of dear delight ; hence nought of sense is theirs.

But if, that things sensatior] may possess, 985
Their seeds primordia] must possess the same,—
Say, from what seeds, then, springs the race of man ἓ
From those, forsooth, incited quick to laugh,

Those down whose cheeks perpetual tears distil,

—For then must seeds While tears of anguish down their cheeks distil.
Hold ροςεῐε adverse, and Jaugh, and shake their Vsn. 1011.
