Bounds it no more when bruis'd by foreign force,

THE NATURE OF TIIINGS.

> Or of its life-blood robb'd,———how canst thou deem

Th' unsolid ether, οι· that aught more rare

Than Hesh itself‚ the soul can e'er confine?

The mind, moreo’er‚ as every hour confirms,

Springs with the body, with the body grows,

And yields alike to years.

The tott’ring habe,

Weakly of limb, betrays a mind as weak :

But, as his strength matures, his vigorous soul

The description is in every one's recollection, and is
far more detailed than either that of Lucretius, or
his imitator : ⁷
At first the infant

Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.

And then the whining school-bey, with his satchel,

And shining morning-face, creeping like snail,

Unwillingly to school. And then the lover, &c-

 

Last scene of all,

That ends this strange eventful history,

Is second childishness, and mere oblivion,

Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans every thing.

Polignae, in copying and enlarging upon Lucre-
tius, has given us this last age of Shakspeare as cor-
rectly as though he had had it in his recollection at
the time :

Densior it sanguis, concrescit vapidus humor,
Durescunt fibrae, flaccescunt denique nervi,
Cor titubat, nec jam radiat vitalibus auris
Thesaurus capiti concreditus ; ossa rigescunt,
Fit pedibus manibusque tremor, grave pectus an-
helat,
Caligant oculi, sonitus male suscipit auris,
Deficiunt vires, vox aegre faucibus exit,
Albescuut crines, rugatur marcida pellis.
Tunc vitio primae eeu debilitatis hebescit
Machina ; fitque senex iterum puer.
Auri-Luca. v. 9442

Slow flows the blood, more spiritless, and dense ;
The fibres harden o’er the flaggy limb53

Close palpitates the heart ς the reservoir‚

Rear’d in the brain its vital ether now

Ejects no longer ς rigid every bone ε

Tremble the feet : the hands, the bosom heaves
Heavy ;—to dimness yields the flickering sight :
Strength fails, and ear and voice tnisgive alike,
And the hair whiteus, and the pale skin sh:·inks 3

Till the machine siuks gradual, and the man
Relapses into childhood.

The reader‚ I am sure, will excuse me for adding
to these parallel passages of different poets, the fol-

lowing, that yields in imerit to none of them, from

the elegant and classic'al Mason :

Pride of the year, purpurea] spring Ξ attend,
And, in the cheek of these sweet innocents‚
Behold thy beauties pictur-‘d. As the cloud
That wecps its moment from thy sapphire heaven,

as the beam
Gilding that cloud, with causeless mirth they

They frown with causeless sorrow ;

smile.
Stay‚ pitying Time! proiong their vernal bliss.—-
Alas ! ere we ean note it in our song·
Comes manhood's feverish summer, chill’d full soon
By cold autumna} care, till wintry age
Sink in the frore severity of death.
