Boon II. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 223

This power to act, though fate the deed forbid,

Urg’d by the will alone? The free-born mind 265
Acts, or forbears, spontaneou33 its own time,

Its place, alike uncertain ε these the will,

Doubtless, alone determines, and, at once,

Flies the fleet motion through th' assenting frame.

Dost thou not see, as down the barrier drops 270
That reins the racer, instant though he dart,

Not half so instant darts he as his soul

Ambitious covers? Deep through all his frame

Th’ elastie nerves must first the wish convey

Ere yet the consentaneous ssight succeed. 275
Hence, obvious, springs all motion from the beart,

Rous'd by the mind's resolve, and instant urg'd

Through every nerve, through every quiv’ring limb.

Qi dominis, idem ardor equis ; face lumina sur· Rehale the vapour of his smother’d ire.

Ora sonant morsu ; spumisque et sanguine, Die ere the contest, and his eager hoof

Claustraque compressae transfumat anhelitus irae:

Stare adeo miserum est, pereunt vestigia mille

Ante sugam 3 absentemque ferit gravis ungula
campum.

There can be little doubt that Pope had this vigo-
rous passage of Lucretius or Statius in his recollec-
tion, when he compiled the following verses :

Sur. Tusa. vi. 390. Th’ impatient courser pants in every vein,

As pants the master, pants alike the horse : And, PaWing’ seems to beat the distant plain ἱ

Flames are his eyes3 his champing mouth re· Hills» ‘mles’ and fl00d⁵ appear already C‘03t2
