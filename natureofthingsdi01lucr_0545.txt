Boox 111„ THE NATURE OF THINGS.

* But springs the vital product of the whole.
This the GREEK schools ‘term HARMoNY——a sense
Of living power while still th' essential soul
No point appropriates—as corporeal health
Flows not from sections but the form entire.
Thus, deem they, springs the mind3 a tenet fraughr‚
If right we judge, with error most absurd.
For oft th’ external frame disease sustains‚
While 311 escapes withinz and thus, revers'd‚
The mind oft sickens while the body thrives:
As, when the gout the tortur'd foot inflames‚
The distant head still boasts its wonted ease.
When, too, sweet sleep o’er all the wearied limbs
Spreads his soft mantle, and locks every sense,
Still something stirs within us —something urg'd,
E'en then to various motions‚ and alive

To joy's glad impulse, or fictitious fears.

Yet more3 to prove the soul a part exists
Constituent of the body—to subvert
This fancied HARMoNY—-mark oft how life
Mid the dread loss of many 3 limb endures;
While instant as the vital heat but ebbs,

The vital breath flies off—-pulsatIOn stops,

And heart, and limb all lifeless lie alike.
