,xcvi TIIE LIFE OF LUCRETIUS.

office, whether of quaestors, praetorS, tribunes, or consuls ; the unprin-
cipled and traitorous conduct of Pompey, who maintained an army
devoted to his own interest, at the very gates os the city; the general
insurrection in Gaul, aud the unsuccesst'ul expedition against the Par-
thianS, are said to have preyed severely upon his heart. While, at the
same time, to complete his affiiction, his beloved friend, Caius Mem-

ensued an interregnum which lasted for seven months, during the
whole of which period Pompey employed the full extent of his infla-2
