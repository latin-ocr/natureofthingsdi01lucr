cii K THE LIFE OF LUCRETIUS.

tion are deeply interesting and pathetic, but cannot be dwelt uopn at
present. Marcus, as is known to every one, was overtaken and slain
at a little farm he possessed at Caieta3 at the time he was searched for,
he was concealed amidst the shades of his garden3 but his retreat was
pointed out by au uugrateful young man, who had formerly been a
slave to Quintus Cicero, and had been emancipated at the particular
request of Marcus, whose affection for him had from this time been
rather that ofa father than of any other relation. His head aud his
right hand were immediately scvered from his body by a tribune whom

his eloquence had not long before savcd from the disgracc ofa public
execution.

The sates of Pomponius Atticus, and of Lucretius Vespillio‚ the two
last of the early friends of our poet, of whom l shall give any account,
were more fortunate, aud they are the only persons who can lay claim
to any degree of success among the whole of this virtuous and patriotic
party. The names of both of them were likewise enrolled in the black
catalogue of the proscribed. Yet against Vespillio, who, as Ι have be-

had seldom or never interfered in the dangerous politics of the day, no
great degree of resentment appears to have prevailed among the trium-
virs ; he was concealcd from his pursuers by an ingenious contrivance
of his wife; aud after the heat of the pursuit was over, he fied at first
to Sulmo, the birth-place of ovid, and afterwards to Cnaeum ἧς, whence,
upon the termination of the civil war, he returned to Rome, and persc-
vcred in his former profession of the law.

Titus Pomponius Atticus was a character of more prominence:
without forfeiting his reputatiou for patriotism, he had hitherto pos-
sessed sagacity enough to be respected, and sought after by all the con-⁷
