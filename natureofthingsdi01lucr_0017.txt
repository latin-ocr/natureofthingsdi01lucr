iffaeknowle'dging his vernacular merit, possesses‚ to the* present hour,
nn version that can· communicate any a‘dequate idea of it to those
unacquainted with Latin; and is still far behind what has been re,-
peatcdly effeeted on the Continent.

Ἴ The best version which has hitherto been offered to the pult-lic, is
thamin Italian, of the justly celebrated rilessandro Marchetti, who
died in 1714, after having been Professor of Mathematics in the Uni-
versity of Pisa during the greater part of his life. Marchetti’s transla—
tion is in blank verse, and is fully eutitled to the high commendatior]
bestowed upon it by his friend Graziani, himself a celebrated poet,
as well as chief seeretary of state to vthe duke of Modena. ‘⁶ You
have translated this poem‚” observes he, in a letter to the Professor,
“ with great felicity and ease; unfolding its sublime and scientific
materials in a· delicate style and elegant mannerg and, what is still
m'o‘re sto be a'd'm'ire‘d, your diction seldom runs into a lengthened pa-
raphrase, and never· without the greatest judgmentssss’ I shall often
have occasion to refer to this version as I proceed, and the reader will
hence be enabled to form‘ his own opinion of its excellence. Mar-
chetti, like Lucretius himself, died before* his ‘labours were in possession
of· the public3 and, probably in consequence of an interdict from the
papal chair, the first edition of his translation was printed in England,
by George Heliam, 1717, in 8vo. being three years after the. transla-
tor's decease. But a much more elegant edition was brought for-
wards at Paris, in 1754, on the fine woven papcr of Olanda, and
aceolnpanied with engravings fron] inmginary, but well-exccnted ‹lc—
signs by Coehin. Yet the vulne of this‘splendid edition is· 11111611
diminished by an almost monh-u}ab!e number os errors, which have
unaccountably been suffered to ercep into the 1611. ,1 new and niort:
