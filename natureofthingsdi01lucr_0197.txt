Boon Ι. THE NATURE oF THINGS. 49

Powerful and true themselves ? But grant such seeds,
And all, as now, through N ature's wide domam,
In time predicted, and predicted place,
Must meet the day concordant3 must assume 195
The form innately stampt‚ and prove alone
’ Why 311 from 311 things never 6311 proceed.
VVhence does the balmy rose possess the spring ?
The yellow grain the summer? or, the vine
With purple clusters‚ cheer th’ autumnal hours Ρ 200
Whenoe, true to time, if such primordial seeds
Act not hmmonious, 6311 aught here survey'd‚
Aught in its season, rear its tender form,
And the glad earth protrude it to the day ?
But, if from nought things rise, then each alike, 205
In every spot, at every varying month‚
Must spring discordant3 void of primal seeds
To check all union till th’ allotted hour.

Nor space for growth would then be needful: 311
'Springing from nought, and still from nought supply’d. 2 10 ⁷
The puny babe would start abrupt to man3
And trees umbrageous, orown’d with fruit mature,

Burst‚ instant, from the greensward. But such facts

Eaeh day opposes3 and, opposing‚ proves

That 311χ things gradual swell from seeds defin’d, 2 15
Of 1366 and rank observant, and intent ⁷

T’ evince th’ appropriate matter whence they thrive.
