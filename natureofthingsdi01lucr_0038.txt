xxiv THE LIFE OF LUCRETIUS.

sesscd, however, that but little real dignity can attach to our philoso-
phic poet srom the former of these ancestors z for he was accused be-
fore thc senate, and at the forum, of having been guilty of the basest
misconduct and rapacity during his different praetorships; of having
made slaves of many families under the immediate protection of the
Roman republic ; of having exacted immense contributions for his pri-
vate use ; and of having even decorated his sumptuous villa at Antium
with paintings plundered from the temple of AEsculapius at Abdera ἕξ.
Chnrges of this kind, indeed, were but too frequently exhibited against
the praetors of almost every province ε like many adventurers to distant
colonics in the present day, they too often solicited these high offices
for the sole purpose of amassing immense foi-tunes in a short period

of time, and when once they had obtained their appointmentS, 1110-
ral rectitudo, and the honour of their country, were completely dis-

carded, and every enginc was set to work that could contribute
to their immediate object in view. Nothing, therefore, could be more
wretched than the situation of a province dependant upon the Ro-
man power: it had the liberty of complaining by ambassadors extra-
ordinary, it must be confest; nor was the government generally in-
different to the accusationis alleged; for the obnoxious viceroy was
commonly removed, but he was, at the same time, as commonly

succeeded by one as iniquitous as himself. With regard to Caius
Lucretius, however, he was not only recalled, and severely repri-
manded, but most heavily fined for his rapacity †.

Yet nothing of this kind of guilt appears to have sullied the cha„
racter of the father of Lucretius Carus. The silence of history respect-
ing him, completely proves that he never possessed any office of great
political distinction or dignity: and it is hence highly probable that,
like his son, he preferred a life of retirement and study to the pomp
