Into this chaotic mass of opinionS‚ Epicurism, however, was never
received. It was founded on physical experiments which could not
be sublimated to the airy regions of Platonism‚ Pythagorism, Cab-
balism, Gnosticism, or Eclectism. The dialectics of Aristotlc might
dazzle by their subtlety and corruscation ; the asseverations of the Stoics
might, in some degree, impose by their dogmatism; the indecision of
the Sceptics might attract by its indolence and independence, but the
system of Epicurus was, in no respect, calculated for the meridiam of
Alexandria. M. Degerando indeed, observes, that in Rome it disco-
vered a disposition to shake hands with the Sceptic school, when on its
(lecay*; but I am acquainted with no fact that can support such an
assei-tion : no philosophy was possessed of more decisivo axioms, and no
disciples could adhere to them with more inflexibility. He is more
correct in observing, as he does shortly afterwards, that “ Epicurus,
Zeno, and the Cyrenaics, contributed no giftto Alexandrian Eclectism;'’
and, that “their maxims were exiled as so many importunate laws, whichv
awakened the spirit, and snatched it from those delicious reveries, in¹
which it loved to lap itself†.’'

On this account, also, we may easily perceive, why Epicurism, or
‘the Atomic doctrine, should have acquired but little notice during the
earlier ages of the Christian church. Ι have already shewn, that what-
ever connection the. latter had formed with the Grecian philosophy, was
‘through the medium of the Samian, Platonic, or Peripatetic schools,.

which appear alternately to have triumphed ovcr each other, and al-
