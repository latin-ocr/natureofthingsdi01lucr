THE NATURE OF THINGS.

373

Or the young kid‚ all tremulous of limb,

Strive with the strength, the fleetness of the horse ?

Thon, sire of science ! with paternal truths

Thy sons entichest z from thy peerless page,

Illustrious chief! as from the flow’ry field

Th' industrious bee culls honey, we alike

Cull many a golden precept—golden each—-

And each most worthy everlastingjife.

Le cygne‚ a qui l'erreur prem des chants aimables,
Et qui n'a pas besoin du mensonge des fables.
Lss Jnmus, Chant. iii.

High o’er the waves, in silver plumage gay,
The stately swan selects his wat'ry way ;

The swan, by fiction grae‘d with sweetest tone,
But never charm who needs beyond his own.

Swans, in Grecian fiction, were the peculiar
property of Venus, and answered the purpose of
flying horses or cherubim, by drawing her a'e'rial
car through the heavens. Camcens has very classi-
cally adhered to this tradition, as also to that of their
musical powerS, in the following verses :

Dentro no carro 0 fflho seu rccebe,
A redea alarga as aves, cujo canto
A Phaetontea morte chorou tanto.
Lusmnos, Cant. ix.

Beneath the reins the stately birds that sing
Their sweet-ton'd death-song spread the snowy
wing. Μιςκιε.

Ver. 1 Ι. Thou, sire qf science .' with patet-nal [νητὸς
] In the original, thus ε

 

Thy sons entiches! .-

Tu, Pater! es rerum inventor3 tu patria nobis
Subpeditas praecepta z
in which the terms patria praecepta, paternal truths,
are quaintly enough conceived by Des Contures‚ to
mean patrioticpreceptm in consequence of which, the
passage is thus translated : “ Vous vous faites part

des preceptes dont vous avez enrichi votre patrie.'’

“ Lucretius‚'’ says he, in a note on this passage,
“ regards the discover-ies of Epicurus as a present
made to au Greece.'’ How much more classical is
the interpretation of Marchetti ;

Tu di cose inventor; tu padre sei ;
Tu ne porgi paterni insegnamente‚ &c.
Ver. 14. we alike
Cull many a golden precept ] It is known
to every one, that the moral verses of Pythagoras
were denominated Χρυσα Επη, “ golden verses :’' and
Faber conjectures, with much propriety‚ that Lu-

 

 

cretius refers to this appellation in the present simile.
Dyer has an allusion to the same passage, drawn from
the sweet employment‚ and the indefatigable industry
of the bee. The English bard is referring to his
own clerical capacity ε

For me, 'tis mine to pray that rnen regard
Their occupations with an honest beart,
And chearsul AIligence ; like the usrjizl bec,
To guther for the hive not sweets alone,

But wax, and each material. Fur-cr, b. ιι.

Mason has employed a similar figure in his impres.
sive Elegy on the Death of Lady Coventry. He is
addressing the vain, the young, and the proud ε

 

while borne on busy wing
Ye sip the nectar ofeach varying bloom,
Nor fear, while basking ἱη the bemus of spring,

The wint'ry storm that sweeps you to the tomb ;
Think of her fate!
