When mounts th’ essential spirit, or from man

THE NATURE OF THINGS.

Th' excreted lymph exhales———the curious eye

Nought marks diminish’d‚—the same weight survives,

The same fixt bulk, since. from minutest seeds

Springs the light scent, th' etherial spirit springs.

Hence doubly flows it why the mind’s pure frame

Must‚ too, be rear'd from seeds of subtlest size,-—-

Hence, as its ssight no visual change creates‚

But bulk alike, and substance still endure.

Yet not unmixt its nature: the light gass

Breath’d from the dying, in its texture blends

Heat, air, and vapour‚ ever each with each

comniunicated to the lungs and heart from the air of

the atmosphere, in the act of respirat-ium and either
secerned or separated by the operation of these or-
gans. Of these various gasses, our poet enumerates
four :—“ heat, air, and vapour,’' as specified in
v. 241 of the present book, and a substance so re-
condite in its nature, and fugitive in its action, as
totally to elude all power of visual detection‚ and
hence, to have had no specific name appropriated to
it; but whose existence, he tells us, is as certain,
from the effecta it is traced to exhibit, as that of any
other gass or aura whatever ς which consists of “ the
lightest and most attenuate atoms ;’' and is, conse-
quendy, excited into the fleetest motion with the ut-
most ease. See v. 248-252- Our poet afterwards
assei-ts, v. 283, that this nameless aura is of infinitely
rnore consequence than any of the rest, towards the
productiori of perception and the preservation of life z

Far from all vision this profoundly lurks.

Through the whole system's utmost depth diffus’d,

And lives, as soul of e'en the soul itself.

From the prime necessity of air to the existence of
man, that part of him which is alone capable of de-
termining whether he do, or do not exist, has, in all
ages, and among all people, derived one of its most
common names from this fluid, and is alternately de-
nominated breath, spirit, and air, terms in themselves
convertible, and etymologically the same. Thus, in
the creation of the first parent of the human race,
we are told, Gen. ii. 7, that God “ breathed into his
nostrils the breath of life, and he became va living
sou 113⁹ ‘The term blood was often, indeed, in a man-
ner somewhat similar, employed, as 1 have already
observed in the note on v, 46 of this book, to impert
the life of sentient beings ; but was always restrained
to the simple phaenomenon of existence, or to the
signification of that part of the percipient principle
which immaterialius intend hythe animal, in opposi-
tion to the intelligent sou! ς while the words air, breath,
spirit, have been uniformly applied as synonymous
denominations for the mind, or thinking principle.
