THE NATURE OF THINGS.

51

But matter thus appropriate, or e'en space

For growth mature, form not the whole requir'd.

ἧ The timely shower from heav’n must add benign

220

Its influence too, ere yet the teeming earth

Emit her joyous produce3 or,

the ranks

Of man and reptile, thence alone sustain'd,

May spring to life, and propagate their kinds.

Say rather, then, in much that meets the view,

225

That various powers combine, concordant all,

vCommon and elemental, a's in words

Such elemental letters,—than contend,

That void of genial atoms, aught exists.

Why form'd not Nature man with ample pow’rs

230

To fathom, with his feet, th' unbottom'd main?

To root up mountains with his mighty hands?

which, as an original publication in this latter lan-
gmge, we have received it into English. This,
however, is but one blunder among a thousand that
might easily be selected from this unrivaued specimen
of sober and classical criticism.

In allusion to this elegant description in the hook
of Job, Milton, who indefatigably examined the
Scriptures, as well for their poetic ornaments as im-
” portant doctrines, thus paints the first production and
appearance of this constellation before its Creator:

—The Pleiades before him danc'd,

Shedding sweet influence.
PAR. Les-r, vii. 370.

Ver. 231. To suthem, with his fiet, th’ unbottom’d
main ?

To root up mountains with his might-y hands ἒ]

As a philosopher, Lucretius was superior to all vulgar

prejudices and stories ; and his uniform aim is to re-
lease the mind from their undue influence. He·
treats, therefore, in these lines, as unauthentie sables
the wonderful relations of Polyphemus, and the
giants. Of the former of whom, we learn from Vir*
gil, what was the popular belief as to his stature ε

 

graditurque per :equor
Jam medium necdum fluctus latera ardua tinxit.
ΖΕΝ. iii. 364.
—through deepest seas he strides,
While scarce the topmost billows touch his sides.
DRYDEN.
Of the latter, this is his description in a differem
poem :

Ter sunt conati imponere Pelio Ossam v
Scilicet et Ossae frondosum involvere Olympum.
Gzoae. i. 288
