DE RERUM NATURA.

Lus. 1.

Veraque constituunt, quae belle tangere possunt

Aureis‚ et lepido quae sunt fucata sonore.

Nam, quur tam variae res possent esse, requiro,

Ex uno si sunt igni, puroque, creatae.

Nihil prodesset enim calidum denserier ignem,

Nec rarefieri‚ si partes ignis eamdem,

Naturam, quam totus habet super ignis, haberent.

Acrior ardor enim conductis partibus esset :

Languidior porro disjectis, disque supatis.

Amplius hoc fieri nihil est quod posse rearis

Talibus in caussis; ne dum variantia rerum

Tanta queat densis, rarisque, ex ignibus esse.

Id quoque, si faciant admixtum rebus inane,

Denseri poterunt ignes, rarique relinqui:

Sed, quia multa sibi cernunt contraria inesse,

’The birth-place of Heraclitus was Ephesus. He
flourished in the reign of the last Darius, about the
59th Olympiad, and in the 5th century before the
commencement of the Christian era. He is reported
to have been much addicted to the study of philoso-
phy, and frequently to have wept over the miseries
and follies of mank³nd. He composed several philo-

was equally so. Darius, after having perused this
work, invited him to the Persian court: but the
philosopher preferred the quiet of retirement to the

splendour of a palace, or the bustle οῗ the busy world'.
He lived in total seclusion from mankind 3 and died
in the 60th year of his age of a dropsy, said to have
been produced by his subsisting upon a vegetable
diet alone.

Ver. 703. But whence, Iask, δα] Our poet pro-
ceeds to demonstrate, that {ire could not be either
the origin of things, or the only substance employed
in their productiori. In support of this denial, he
advances five arguments.—Fire is a substance uniform
and homogeneous, but the phaenomena of nature are
various and opposite. Fire may indeed produce oc-
casional changes in the appearance of things by rare-
fying some bodies more than others 3 but if the parts
of a dense body recede, and become rare, a vacuum
must, of course, exist between the parts so receding a
