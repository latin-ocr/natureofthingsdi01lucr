xvi PREFACE.

manifest imitations of the language of the Song of Songs. Dr. Hodg-
son has, indeed, ascended very considerably higher, and even chal·
lcnges Anacreon with having copied, in a variety of instances‚ from
this inimitable relic of the sacred poctry of Solomon. This accusation
may, perhaps, be doubtful; but it would be easy to prove, if the dis-
cussion were necessary in the present place, that, during the dynasty of
the Ptolemies, not only the Muses osAonia were indebted to the Muse
of Sion, but that the eclectio philosophy, which first raised its monster

they are important in their doctrines; and that, whatever be the
boast of Greece and Rome with respect to poetic attainments‚ they are
often equalled, and occasionally surpassed by the former. The man
who, professing the Christian religion, is acquainted with the an·

criticism; he has, otherwise, neglected his truest interest, and lived
but for little purpose in the world. Ι delight in profane literature,
but still more do I delight in my Bible: they are lamps, that afford
a mutual assistance to each other. In point of importance, however,
