DE „RERUM NATURA.

Lm. ΙΙ.

Lanigerae reptant pecudes, quo quamque vocantes

Invitant herbae, gemmantes rore recenti 3

Et satiatei agnei ludunt, blandeque coruscant:

320

Omnia quae nobis longe confusa videntur,

Et veluti in viridi candor consistere colli.

Praeterea, magnae legiones quom loca cursu

Camporum conplent, belli simulacra cientes;

opportunity of introducing it. The following, of

the cardinal Polignac, is probably copied from Lu-
cretius, whose unrivalled poetry he was as anxious to
imitate, as his principles he was studious to oppose :

Jamque laborati duro snb cortice succi

Erumpunt ; frondemque et flores, ordine miro, ⁶

Implicitos‚ unctae monstrant in acumine gemmae.
Auri-Lmen. iv. 797.

Th’ elaborate juices from the tough bark now

Burst f01·th; and flowers and.foliage, wond'rous
wove,

Gleam from each pearly budlet.

A passage, to the same effect, is to be found in
Dyer’s Fleece, a poem by no means deficient in clas-
sical allusions, and pregnant with picturesque paint-
ings, drawn with a master’s hand from nature z

wait till all
The crystal dews impearl'd upon the grass
Are touch'd by Phoebus’ beams, and mount aloft.

 

The term crystal is, with equal felicity, applied by
Ovid to the frost that, in the same manner, is scat-
tered every morning over trees and fields‚ in the ear-
lier spring ε

Tempus erat vitrasi quo primum terra prm‘mi

Spargitur, et tectae fronde queruntur aves.

This couplet of Ovid is imitated by Ariosto, in
his Orlando Furioso; and it is somewhat singular,
that Mr. H001e‚ in his translation of both poets, has
made use of the phrase glittering and sparkling dew,
instead of glittering οι· crystalsrost.

Fin che l’ Aurora e la gelata brina
Dalle dorate ruote in terra sparse,
E s'udir le Aleione, &c- anr. x.

Tin, from her golden wheels, Aurora threw
On verdant meads the drops of sparkling dew,
And on the margin of the wavy flood

Alcyone her ancient plaints renew'd. Hoote.

In his version of the above passage os Ovid, he has,
with a similar error, written

Now earth first glitters with the morning dew,
And birds, in bow'ry shades, their plaints renew.

Calpurnius, in his fifth eclogue, has a few verses
so extremely consentaneous with the imagery of Lu-
cretius, more especially when accompanied with the
classical amendment of Mr. Wakefield, that I should
be'guilty of an unpardonable omission, if I were to
pass them by ι

 

ante diem pecus exeat: humida dulces
Efficit aura cibos, quoties, fugientibus umbris,
Frigida nocturno tinguuntur pascua rore,

Et matutinae lucent in gramine gemmae. Ver. 52.

Lead forth betimes thy cattle ; the moist air
Sweetens the herbage 3 lead them when, the shades
Fast flying, the cool glebe is thick besprent

With midnight dew-drops 3 and the gems of mom
Gleam o'er the greensward.

 

Ver. 3 30. One white mass formitzg o'cr the verdun!
Ἀπίκια] So, Dyer:

Such are the downs of Banstead, edg’d with mods,

And tow’ry villas ; such Dorcestrian -fields‚

Whose flocks innum’rous whitcn all the land.
