DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. I.

Corporis obficium est quoniam premere omnia deorsum:

Contra autem natura manet sine pondere inanis.

Ergo, quod magnum est aeque, leviusque videtur,

365

Nimirum plus esse sibi declarat inanis;

Ut contra gravius plus in se corporis esse

Dedicat, et multo vacuum minus intus habere.

Est igitur¹ nimirum id, quod ratione sagaci

QuaerimUS‚ admixtum rebus3 quod inane vocamus.

Illud, in hiis rebus ne te deducere Vero

Possit, quod queidam fingunt, praecurrere cogor.

Ver. 418. But some there are such doctrines who
deny:] In the progress of this poem, we

shall have abundant illustrations of the general
truth of that apophthegm of Solomon, that “there
“ is nothing new under the sun.'' The arguments
adduced in favour of a vacuum, and which have the
appearance of being unanswerable, by Democritus
and Epicurus, were, nevertheless, controverted by
Zeno and Aristotle3 who contended that all nature
was full of matter, and there was no vacuity in any
point of creation. Lucretius, and other pupils of
the Epicurean school, adher-ed to, and continued to
advance the same doctrine at Rome: they were,
opposed by Cicero and Seneca. The same argu-
ments were addacem and the same objections re-
torted. The world grew tired of the contest, and it
snbsided. At length Des Cartes and Newton arose,
and the contest was revived: a material plenum
was contended for by the former, and a vacuum as
strenuously asserted by the latter. Like the reviv-
al of an old fnshion, the dispute was once more

new to the wor1d; and all were anxious to become
ontologists and mathematicians. Sir Isaac had, un-
doubtedly, the advantage of his adversar-y. His ar-
guments, or rather those which had been formerly
advauced, and were now advanced again, were by far
the most cogent ; and his proselytes the most nume-
rous. But the world was not fully convinced on the
death of both of them. The defence of a plenum
was entailed on Leibnitz, and that of a vacuum οιι
Euler. The same demonstrations were mutual& ad-
vanced, and the same objections mutually urged. Am
1 doing injustice to the ingenuity of the moderns?
Let, then, two or three examples suffice. More
might easily be selected, but I will not so far tres-
pass on the reader’s time.

‘¹ All bodies about the earth‚'’ observes Sir Isaac
Newton, in answer to the doctrine of Des Cartes,
“ gravitate towards the earth; and the weights of
‘⁶ all bodies, equally distant from the earth’s centre,
are as the quantities of matter in those bodies,” &c-
Princip. lib. ii.
