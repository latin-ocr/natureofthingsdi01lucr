DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. ΙΙ.

Linquit humi pedibus vestigia pressa bisulcis ;

Omnia convisens oculis loca, si queat usquam

Conspicere amissum fetum : conpletque querelis

-Frundiferum nemus, adsistens ; et crebra revisit

Nor yet from rocks delicious streams that roll
As amber clear, can soothe his sorrowing soul.

There is an epssode, so perfectly similar, in the
Alaameriyyo of the Arabian poet Lebid, which
constituted one of the Moallakzst, or Seven Poems,
that were transcribed in letters of gold, and sus-
pended in the temple of Mecca, that I cannot avoid
inserting it, for a comparison with Lucretius: Those,

who copy from Nature, cannot widely differ in

their picture, let them copy when and where they
may.

The entire poem may be found in Sir William
Jones’s VVorks, vol. iv. in which we are also favoured
with the following elegant version z

‘¹ Is this the swiftness of my camel? No; rather
she resembles a wild εονν, whose calf has been de-
voured by ravenous beasts, when she had suffered
him to graze apart, and relied for his protection on⁶
the leader of the herd.

of the desert, have divided his mangled limbs, and
their feast has not been interrupted.
