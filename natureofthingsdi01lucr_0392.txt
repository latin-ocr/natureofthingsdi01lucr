opinion, that it is a substance sm' generis, resurg-
ing from its ruins. Professor Pictet invented, some
years ago, an instrument, by which he endeavoured
to prove, that cold bodies transmitted frigorific rayS»
which might be concentrated in a convex mirror, and
sensibly affect a delicate air thermometer : and Count
Rumford, building upon this idea, has engaged in a
course of additional experiments, and written a very
ingenious paper, in which he has given their result,
and his own consequent opinion; which appears to
be, that frigorific γεγε, or emanations, issue from all
cold bodies in the same manner as calorific emana-
tions from hot; and that the cold experienced on
the summit of high mountains, as well as the regu-
lated temperature of the earth, is produced by the in-
termixture of such frigorific rays transmitted from
the heavens with the calorific rays of solar heat. But
as whatever emanates or radiates must be a substance,
the frigorific rays of cold bodies, aud the calorific of
hot, must be necessarily and equally substantiah and
consequently‚ cofid itself‚ as well as heat3 which is
the doctrine maintained in the text. See Philosoph.

heat, or ᾗτε, is still indeed ranke-d among philoso-

Elementary

phers as an independent and essential substance ;
though it seems doubtful how long, even heat itself
may be allowed to preserve its primitive rank and dig-
nity. Light and fire, it is generally maintained, are
one and the same thing, produced by one and the
same cause. But those who, with such a belief, en-
tertam, at the same time, the theory of Euler with
respect to light, must altogether discard the mate-
riality of lire, and conceive of it, as Euler did of the
former, to he nothing more than a vibratory motion

 

of the particles of the combustible body, or of the
elastic medium of the air, by which the sensation of
heat is communicated to the touch in the same man-
ner as the sensation of sound is cxcited in the ear.
Sec note on ver. 166 of this book. And this, from
some of his earlier papers, appears to have been the
theory of Count Rumford himself, notwithstanding
the discrepancy of such an opinion with that 1 have
just noticed. Yet, perhaps, this discrepancy exists
rather in the wording of his hypothesis, than in any
necessary hostility of one part of it to another.

The comprehensive and elaborate theory of Epicu-
ruS‚however, not onlyallowedan actual and material ex-
istence to elementary heat and cold, but attributed to
the primary corpuscles ofeach‚ a certain and definite
mechanical figure,bymeansofwhich their different ope-
ratione were effected. Consistently‚ therefore, with the
general position advanced by our poet, ver. 405, and
following, that every thing pleasant and grateful to
the senses is formed from atoms perfeetly smooth
and round, while, whatever is hateful and disgusting
is educed from pointed or jagged atoms,—Epicurus
determined, that the atoms of both elemental heat
and cold, were pointed, or, as Lucretius terms them,
indented : but, as exciting different effects, that they
were pointed or indented differently: those of heat
being in some degree round or orbicular‚ with little
points abutting from the surface of the corpuscle,
while those of cold, on the contrary, were angulas
and pyramidal, or polygons of three sides( ln his
epistle to PythocleS, he gives this reason for the con-
version of water into ice, that ‘⁸ the orbicular atoms
(meaning those of heat) are, at this time, extruded
from the water, and those of a trigonic and acutangular
