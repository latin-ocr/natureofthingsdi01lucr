Βοοκ ΙΙ. ΤΗΕ NATURE OF THINGS. 319

,Boast no sensation though alike educ'd ?--
Yet mark, attentive‚ the sage muse ne’er yet 900
Has urg'd that all things doubtless must alike
Spring forth percipient, and with 361136 endu'd:
But that of vast concern, as hence alone,
Sensation ceaseless flows—the modes diverse
Of motion, order, form, with which, through time, 905
Primordial atoms blend z—-modes the dull clod
Knows not, its frasne unorganiz’d and rude.
Though the dull clod, or sapless root as dull,
When the moist show’r the putrid strife has rous’d,
Themselves the vermin race in crowds create3 9¹0
Chang'd, then, their nature, from arrangements new,
And full empower’d perceptive life to rear.
Those, too, who hold that sentient forms throughout

Spring but from sentient seeds‚ those seeds must deem

Soft and unsolid, since unsolid all, 915
And soft each region, where sensation reigns,
Th’ interior bowels, and the flesh without 3>
And hence such seeds must doubtless waste to nought.
Yet grant their dates eternal: such must then
The total sense possess of things they rezir, 920
Or sense of sep'rate parts: but parts alone
Have no perception, nor alone can live.

Each leans on each 3 the loose dismember’d hand
