Boon Ι. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 83

And were not SPACE, were vacuum not allow'd‚ 475
In nought could bodies, then, their powers display
Of various actiont each compressing each
To motion fatal, as already sung.
Nor is there aught such vacant SPACE besides,
And MATTER close-embodied‚ can be trac'd 480
A substance forming discrepant from each.
Search where thou wilt, whate'er occurs to view,
Of bulk minute, or large, tho’ e’en its form
Change with the hour, if tangible it prove,
This stamps it MATTER, and forbids all doubt. 485
Eut if intangible‚ throughout if still
To matter pervious, act where'er it may,
’Tis‚ then, void SPACE, and can be nought besides.
All things, moreo'er, a substance must evince
Acting, or suffering act3 or, form the sphere 490
In which to act or suffer. But to act
Or suffer action, must be MATTER’S sole3
While SPACE alone that needed spherc admits.
Nought then, ’twixt SPACE and MATTER can subsist
Of INTERMEDIATE SUBsTANcE: nought be trac'd 495
By keenest efforts of th’ externa] sense,
Or by the meditating mind deduc'd.
All else we meet with, or conceive but these

Are mere CONJUNcrroNS‚ or EVENTS attach’d.
