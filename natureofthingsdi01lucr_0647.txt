THE NATURE OF THINGS.

With his own future corse, whose dread decay

This self, he deems‚ must witness and partake.

Hence heaves his heart indignant at the (loom

Of mortal man: heedless that, after death,

No other self shall then himself bemoan,

Nor feel the tooth that tears his mangled limbs.
If too, the tiger's tusk, the vulture's beak,

Be deem'd an ill—what lighter ill results

From the red fury of the fun'ral pyre?

The fulsome tide of honey, o'er the frame

Pour'd, cold and stiff’ning in the marble tomb ?

The body ofAleJtander the Great is well known to
have been preserved in the same manner: and it is
unquestionable, that the following couplet of Statius
refers to this circumstance :

Duc et ad AEmathios manes, ubi belliger urbis
Conditor, Hyblaeo perfusus nectare, durat.
SiLv. 111. ii. 117.

Go, search the tombs, th’AEmathian victor’s there,
Steep'd in the nectar Hybla’s blossoms bear.

It is a curious coincidence of circumstances, that,

while the Eritish conquests in Asia are rapidly ap-
proaching on the west, or rather perhaps have alrea-
dy reached the limits of the conquests of this bold
and successful warrior, the costly tomb to which his
remains were committed, and [υ which our poet, in
all probability, allodes, ,should be at this moment in
the possessiones the same country. For that the
large and beautiful sarcophagus, sur'1·ender<d, among
many other curious antiquities, by Gen. Menou to
lord Hutchinson, upon the capture of Alexandria, and
now in the Eritish h'Iuseum, was the idenziscl tomi)
in which the corse of Alexander was depositcd a'r'ttr
his death and embalming, has been of late inco tro-
vertibly prov d hy the coizjoint and very erudite, as
well as entertainiug‚ res-earches of Dr. Clarke, and my

learned friend the Rev. S. Henlcy.

The custorn of embalming is supposed to have ori—
ginated in Egypt: whence the Hebrews, and espe-
cially after the residence of Joseph in that country,
introduced it very generally among themselves. The
body of Jacob was therefore prepared in this man-
ner, the process occupying forty days before its
completion3 some time after which, it was con-
veyed, with much funeral pomp, to the sepulchre
he had excavatcd in Canaan. Sec Gen. cap. l.
2, 3. The body of our Saviour was intended, bv
Joseph of Ariniathca, to whom Pilate had granted
it, to have been preserved in the sanie way: it
was accordingly enveloped in clean linen, and depo-
sited in its appropriate tomb ; and the mater-iah were
actually prepared, when, by liis resurrection, lie reu-
dered the friendly interposition of joseph aud ris
