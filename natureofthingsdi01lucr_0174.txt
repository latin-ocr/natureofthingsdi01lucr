rowed many of his most delicate touches. But he has
given the entire tale a different, and, in my judgment,
a more natural action, as well as one more consistent
with the narration of the best historians. Instead of
painting that sorrow and affliction of mind which our
poet has here so correctly delineated‚ Euripedes gives
the unfortunate princess the character of a heroine,
voluntarily offering herself as a victim sor the good
of her country, and of Greece at large.

The Greek tragedian has also introduced a dif-
ferent termination, and represented the fair victim as
removed by a miracle from the sacred grove, at the
moment she was on the point of being immolated,
and her place supplied by a deer, provided by Diana
in her stead: in which latter fiction he has been
followed by Ovid, in his Metamorphoses, book xii.
This story is generally supposed to be derived from
that of Jephtha, so pathetically related in the book
of Judges; and from the resemblance of the nameS,
as also from Jephtha’s having lived at the era of
the siege of Troy, it is probable both memoirs are
derived from one common source. The sacred his-
torian, however, coincides in the catastrophe intro-
duced by Lucretius, and represents the unhappy
victim as actually sacrificed: but he agrees with
Euripedes, in attributing to her the heroism of a
voluntary surrender. The following is the de-
scription of the Grecian dramatist, which, though
highly beautiful, is not superior to that of our

own poet z

Soon as we reach’d the grove and flowery mead
Of Dian, where your daughter was conducted
By a detachment of the Grecian troops,
The host collected instantly around ;
But Agamemnon, soon as he beheld
The virgin at the sacred grove arrive,
Where she was doom'd to bleed, groan'd deeply,
turn’d
His head ashie, then wept and veil'd his eyes
Beneath his robe. Close to her sire she stood,
And said, “ My father, 1 with joy attend
‘⁶ Thy summons, freely for my native land,
“ And for all Greece, devote myself to bleed ;
“ Conduct me to the altar of the goddess ;
“ Because Heaven’s awful voice hath thus requir'd.
“ Through me may ye be blest, through me obtain
‘⁶ The glorious palm of conquest, and return
“ To your exulting country.''

The fable is undoubtedly well calculated for dra-
matic representation ; and the moderns have had re-
course to it almost as frequently as the ancients.
The corresponding drama of Buchanan, as derived
more immediately from the account given in the sa-
cred Scriptures, is entitled “ Jephthes :'’ but in his
catastrophe he has equally departed from his own
copy, as well as from Lucretius 3 following the ὦσι-
steps and peripaetia of Euripides and ovid. In his
elegant description of his heroine, however, whom
he denominates lphis, he has been chiefly indebted
to our own poet, having minutely copied almost every

, trait in the text before us. Iphis, in the drama of

Buchanan, having taken a pathetic sarewel of her pa-
rents, in which she alludes to her own maturity of age,
and the bridal hopes that had so lately surrounded her,
is thus exquisitely painted, on the very verge of fate a
