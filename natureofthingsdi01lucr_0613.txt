THE NATURE OF THINGS.

463

Severs a limb, that o’er the field it lies

With life long quiv'ring, while the hero still

Fights on of pain unconscious:
Absorb'd so total, he nor heeds the loss

his high soul

Of his broad shield, or shield-supporting hand,

Whirl'd in the strife of coursers‚ and of cars.

From this the sword-arm drops, while still the rock

He climbs impetuous3 that, perclmnce, to earth

Fell’d, on one leg yet vainly strives to rise 3

660

While, at his side, his amputated foot

The horseman listeth up alike.
Numerous the slain ! innumerable the dead bodies 1

Yea, no end of the carcases !
Over their carcases they stumble.

Ver. 658. From this the swerd-arm drops‚—]
Thus, Homer:

Tou μεν αρ’ Ευρυτῖυλος, Euonymos· α’γλαος iilos,
Ham-622 {Ona φευγοντα, μετατρῦμῡιέην ελασ·’ Lupo-a,
ψασνανῳ affer-5· απο δ’ εξεσε >cupa Boeysuzv.

Αἱματοεσσοι δε χειρ negt? πεσε

Ιι. Ε. 81.

 

On him, amidst the flying numbers found,

χ Eurypilus inflicts a deadly wound ;

On his broad shoulder fell the forceful brand,
Thence‚glancing downward, lopp’d his holy hand,
VJhich stain'd with sacred blood the blushing

saud. ΡΟΡΕ.

And thus Virgil, in a passage which Lambinus
asserts he composed with this of our poet in his re-
collection :

Te decisa suum, Laride, dextera quaerit :
Semianimesque micant digiti, ferrumque retractant·

ΖΕΝ. x. 395.

Laris* hand,
Dssmembee’d, sought r't's owner on the strand :

 

The trembling fingers yet the faulchion strain,
And threaten still th' intended stroke in vain.

In the following passage of Ercilla, which de-
scribes thejvretched remains of the Spanish army on
entering the city of Conception‚ after its total de-
feat and rout by the brave Lautaro, there is a force
and spirit which will amplyjustify its insertion :

Puedese imaginat qual llegarian

Del trabajo y heridas maltratados‚

Algunos casi rostros no maian,

Otros los tmen de golpes levantados.
Del infierno parece que salian,

No haman, ni responden elevados,

A todos con los ojos rodeavan,

Y mas callando el dano declaravan.

ARAUCAN. Cant. vii.

Their entrance in these walls let fancy paint,

O’erwhelm’d with anguish‚ and with labour faint :

These, gash’d with ghasl& wouncls, those, wrieh'zl

with pain,

And some their human semblance scarce retain ;

They seem'd unhappy spirits ’scap’d from hell,

Yet wanting voice their misery to tell.

Their pangs‚ to all, their rolling eyes express,

And silence most declares their deep distress.
Hanni.
