THE NATURE OF THINGS. 311

This every fact of every day, if scann'd‚

F ar from resisting‚ proves a truth most sirm ;

ployment of two or more substances, where one is
amply sufficient, is altogether unphilosophic, and in-
consistent with the simplicity of nature.

I have said that matter, in its utmost state of de-
composition and individuality, is divested of all power
whatsoever. The simplest and the most general
power of which we find it possest, is that of gravita-
tion. But a monador individual atom of primitive
matter, if placed alone in the immensity of space,
could not possess even the property of gravitation :
for gravitation implies the existence of two or more
particles mutually attracting each other: and New-
ton has justly ridiculed the idea of innate attraction
as an absurdity. Matter, in all its compound forms,
necessarily therefore evinces the property of gravita-
tion: it must, however, be in a compound state, or
even this simplest and most general of all properties
could not be evinced. But the modes in which the
different particles of matter combine, may be varied
almost to infinity : and a different power must of ne-
cessity be educed by every variation that occurs.
Modified in one way, matter evinces the power of
magnetism ; in another way, that of electricity ; in a
third, that of chemical affinitics; and in a fourth,
that of vegetable or fibrous irritability 3 till, at length,
it acquire the strong stimulative perfectior) of the
mimosa pudica, 01 the dionaea muscipula; and will
either shrink from the touch of the intruding insect,
or contract its libres, and kill it by a elench. When
then we ascend thus high, in what should seem to
be the natural scale of sensation, it is attended, I
think, with no great difficulty, to suppose, that ani-
mal as well as vegetable irritability is the result of a
peculiar organization of simple and unirritable ma-
terial corpuscleS.

But let us examine, in a few words, the first ori-
gin οἱ animals, and their mode of acquiring exist-
ence. In what does it* differ from that of the ve-
getable world? The most severe scrutiny of man
can trace no kind of irritability in the seeds of any
description of plants. There is a peculiar organi-
zation3 but no species of feeling or irritability what-

ever—net even in those of the planis} have jiistl1csm·e
made mention of, the mimosa‚ or the dionaea mucci-
pula, ur even the hedysaruni movens, which exhibits a
perpetual motion in the sun-shine. But these eecds
are enti-usted to the earth : by the action ofthe earth
their filaments are either evol-»ed or augmented ς a new
state of organization, a new modificaticn of matter
is produced, and a new property, that of irritability,
is created. In the same manner, the new-lain fe-
cundated egg of an oviparons ¹animal has no more cf
either irritability οι· sensation than the seed of a
plant. It consists merely of matter in a peculiar,
but certainly an insensate, :tate of organization.
that then is super-added to it to produce the per
ception it is shortly destined to possess ? The mother
broods over ir for a certain period of time ς but the
mother communicares nothing but hear, which is it-
self a material substancez for a common oven, judi-
ciously warmed, will hatch the inclosed chick just as
soon, and as safely. A change, therefore, is pro-
duced in a given time by the application of a definite
quantity of heat, or of matter differently arranged in
the oi·ganization of the interior substance of the egg,
in the same manner as in that of the vegetable seed ;
and from a new modification ofits matter is produced
a new and superior property ι the fetus becomes
gradually endowed with the power of sensation.

It is precisely the same thingvin man. Vt‘hen the
embryon descends from the ovar-ium into the uterus,
upon one system os physiology‚ or when the seminal
fluids of the male and female unite in the uterus, and
form the first filaments of the fetus, upon another
system, it is obviously at this time devoid of all sen-
sation whatever. The placenta supplies it with oxy.
gen, the liquor of the uterus, perhaps, with nutri-
ment, though this is uncertain ς yet no research
whatever can trace any thing added to it, but differ-

ent material substances. In process of time, how.

ever, a new organization is gradually produced ; for
the first ovum‚or embryon filaments,no more resemblts
the future fetus, than the seed or the egg resembles
the future plant or bird, aud, with the productiori ef
