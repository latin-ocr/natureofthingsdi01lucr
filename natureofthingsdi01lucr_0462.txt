multiplies by splitting transversely3 and every species
of it, as well as many other animals of the order
Gymnarthridia, as the asterias and hirudo viridis,
may be propagated by sections, with as much ease as
the most simple plant whatever; and these sections
may be perpetually renewed without the failure of an
individual part. The dart millepes affords increase
by a spontaneous separation, about two-thirds below
the head, into two distinct and perfect animals ; and
we know of no other mode by which it can continue
its species. The animalcules found in infusions of
animal and vegetable substances, and indeed, all mi-
cmscopic animalcules, multiply by continued divisions
and subdivisimus, something in the same mannen and
various minute experiments of Saussure sufficiently
prove, that sexual copulation, even if a difference of
gender subsist among them, which has never been
traced‚ and in all probability does not subsist, has no
effect in the present instance ι for animalcules of this
class taken away, on the moment of separation
from the parent insect, and put separately into distinct
drops os water, still continue to exhibit the same pro·
lific property without any diminution of power,
There is another species mentioned by Bonnet‚ as ex—
isting in the infusion of he mpseeds, that divides cross-
wise, aud separates in every new generation, into four
distinct and perfect animalcules at the same time. It
is probable, that all these are without sexual distinc-
tions; and notwithstanding the general adherence of
the disciples of Linneus to a contrary doctrine, it is
equally probable that a vast variety of vegetables
exist, which are in like manner devoid of sexual cha-
racter. The bread-fruit tree of Otaheite, artocarpus
incisus of Linneus, is a case completely in point3 the
propagation of which is highly curious and enter-
taining, but would occupy too much space to be
minutely described in the present note. And although
such sexual characters have been traced among many
plants, inserted by the Swedish naturalist, in the order
Cryptogamia, since his decease, yet '3t is a very nu-
merous order still, and 1 apprehend will ever con-
nnuc so.

Many vegetables have a power of propagating
both by seeds and bulbs as well as buds, at the same
time ; that is, both oviparously and viviparously ε and
the aphis puceron or vine-fretter has been detected
by Bonnet to possess a power perfectly similar, its
young being viviparous in the fun heat of summer,
and oviparous in the latter and more chiny months of
autumn. There are various other families of flies that
are supposed to be equally gifted. The capability
of ingrafting is not peculiar to vegetables3 the fresh-
water polypus and the sea-nettle (actinia) will endure
the process with an cqual degree of ease and effect.

The young of many animale are brought into the
world in a state of extreme imper-fection, without the
sense of sight, or the use of their limbs ; in other in·
stances, they are able to assist themselves from the
moment of their birth. So, while the seeds of most
plants fall upon the earth in a domant state, and
require much care to render them productive, in the
festuca vivipara and a few others, they begin to ve.
getate in the parent plant, and drop upon the soil
with roots ready formed, perfect in all their powers,
and capable of immediate increment.

Most plante that are propagated by sexual con-
nexion possess hermaphrodite corollas; that is to say,
every individua! corolla posseses both the male and
female organs of generation in itself. The corolla·
of the cucumber, however, as well as all other plante
of the class Monoecia, are male and female separately,
and require the conjoint faculties of the two to pro·
pagate their· kind. There are other planta, again,
that are male or female through every flower pro-
duced ι and of consequence, unless the female herb be
situated in the vicinity of the male, it will be barren
through the whole term of its existence. Such is the
order Dioecia of Linneus.'Among animals we seldom
meet with more than the organs of a single sex at-
tached to eaehindividual. Reports of hermaphrodite8
have not been uncommon, indeed, both amidst qua-
drupeds and mankind; and nature certainly appears
to have sported occasionally in this way, but never in

such a manner as to have rendered the possession of
