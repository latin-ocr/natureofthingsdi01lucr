Boon< Ι. THE NATURE OF THINGS.

Melt in the fierce volcano: gold and brass
Forego their icy hardneSS, and alike
Yield in the fiery conflict‚ and dissolve:
That e'en the silves chalice‚ fill’d with lymph
Fervid or cold‚ unlocks its secret poreS,
And warnis, at once, or chills th’ embracing hand.
Hence <leem they matter pervious all, and void
Of solid substance. But attend, benign,
And, since right reason, and the frame of things
Demand the verse, the muse shall briefly prove
The seeds, the principles of matter all
Both solid, and eternal, whence alone
Springs the stupendous fabric of the world.

Of SPAcE‚ of MATTER, as already sung,
Th’ ENTIRE of things consists, by nature form'd
Distinet and adverse3 and existing pure
Each uncontrol’d of each. Where matter dwells

Void space can ne'er be found, nor matter found,

Search where thou wilt, where space resides and reigns.

As space is vacant then, material seeds

Must solid prove, perforce‚ and free from void.
Thus, τοο, as vacuum dwells in all produc’d‚

Some solid substance must that vacuum bound:

Nor aught of vacuum can created things

Be prov’d t’ enclose, if solids not exist,
