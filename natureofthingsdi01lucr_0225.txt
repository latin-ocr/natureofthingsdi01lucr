Boox I. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 77

Not through imagin'd pores admits the race 420
With glitt’ring scales—but yields at once, and opes
The liquid path3 and occupies, in turn,
The space behind the aureat fish deserts.
Thus, too, that all things act: the spot possess'd
Exchanging sole, whilst each continues full. 425
Believe them not. If nought of space the wave
Give to its gilded tenants‚ how, resolve,
F eel they the power t' advance? and if t' advance
They know not, how can, next, the wave thuS yield ?--·
Or matter ne’er can move, then, or within 430
Some vom must mix through all its varying formS‚
Whence springs alone the pow’r of motion first.
When force mechanic severs, and, abrupt,
Drives two broad bodies distant, quick between
F lows the light air, and fills the vacuum form’d. 435
But ne'er so rapid can the light air flow
As to forbid all void3 since, step by step,
It still must rush till the whole space be clos'd.
Nor credit those who urge such bodies sole
Can part because the liquid air, compress’d 440

To closer texture, gives the needed space.

into the idea the poet meaned to convey‚ when he pose, that his annotator, to whom he is much in-
reached this passage: and his version of it is, hence, debted, has thought it necessary to explain the tran-
so incorrect‚ so confused, and foreign from the pur· slation itself‚ by a commentary of three pageS.
