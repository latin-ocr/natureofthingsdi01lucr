THE NATURF. OF THINGS.

For labour now, so foods forbear to rise.

Thus musing, the rude husbandman shakes oft

In a passage, predicting the return of these happy
dayS, Virgil, as well as Ovid, has bem indebted to

our poet :

Molli paulatim flavescet campus aristzi,
Incultisque rubens pendebit sentibus uva,

Et durae quercus sudabunt roscida mella.
Ecn. IV. v. zss.

Pope’s beautiful imitation of this passage, wiil
serve as a version of it :

The swain, in barren deserts, with surprize,

Sees lillies spring, and sudden verdure n‘se;

And starts amidst the thirsty wilds to hear

New falls of water murmuring in his ear.

The opinion of a golden age, or anterior period of
superior happiness, is common to most natium, and
probably originated from different traditions concern-
ing the Garden of Eden. The modern Bramins
look back to such an epoch with as firm a belief in
its existence as the ancient Greeks: and the Saturn
of the latter is the Dushwanta of the former. There
isa poem in Sanscrit with this title, or rather entitled,
Dushwanta and Sacontala, which is said to be even
older than the aera of Calidas, which thus refers to
this age of consummate beatitude. “During the
reign of Dushwanta, no one worked at the plough,
or in the mines, because the earth yielded her riches
spontaneously ς nor any one offended against the laW.
As the people delighted in justice, so they obtained
justice, and the object of their wishes. There was no·
fear of thieves, no dread of poverty, no apprehension
of disease. The clouds rained in due season‚ the
fruits were full ofjuicc‚ and the earth aboundcd with
herds, and flockS, and every p1⁴eci0·us thing.'' Ori-
ental Repository, Vol. II.

An opinion, somewhat similar, is to be traced
among most of the Christian fathers. St. Cyprian
thus expresses himself, in an epistle to Demetrius:
Scire debes jam mundum non illis viribus stare qui-

bns prins steterat, &c. ‘⁵ Acquaint thyself with this
fact, that the earth is not now poss-est of the same
degree of vigonr which she possest formerly. On
this subject, although the Scriptures, and our most
eminent divines, were silent, yet the world itself
would speak, and even testify the cause of so woeful
a change. We enjoy not in Winter the same abun-
dance or quantity of showers for fecundating the
seattered seeds which was formerly bestowed: we
feel not in summer the same quantity of heat for
ripening the fruits of the earth. In the Spring it-
self we have less promise of plenty ς and in the Au-
tumn the trees and general herbage are less abundant.
Even in the bowels of the earth, there are fewer
fossils and precious stones: less silver and gold; for
the metals themselves are diminishing, and their
vcins of ore are contracting daily. There are fewer
harvest-men in the fields, fewer sailors on the ocean,
fewer soldiers in the camp. There is less innocenee
in civil life; less justice in the mnnicipal courts, less
constancy in fficndship, less skill in the arts, less
discipline in our morals. All things, indeed, must
diminish, as they necessarily hasten to decay, and
will shortly attain their lest honr of existence.”

This is a dismal picture for succeeding gene-
rations to contemplate, and probably, the worthy
father has a little too highly coloured it. But the
principle advanced both by himself and Lucretius, so
sar as it relates to natural phaenomena, is countenanced,
I think, in sorne measure, us well by physieal and phi-
losophie views, as by divine revelation. Although
not an animalized‚ homogeneous being, the earth is,
at least, a systematized material substance3 and it
seems totally contrary to the nature of things, that
a material substance of any kind should either con-
tinue for ever, or exist without gradual decay.
Such gradual decay, indeed, is the common course of
nature at large3 for every thing, great or small, is
by degrees dissolving into its original elements. Nor
is this species of destruction confined to the globe we
