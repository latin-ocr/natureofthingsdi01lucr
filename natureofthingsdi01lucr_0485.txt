Boox ΙΙ. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 3

Cease, then, alarm’d by aught profound, or strange,
Right reason to reject3 weigh well the proofs
Each scheme advances3 if by truth upheld
Embrace the doctrine ; but, if false, abjure.
Urg'd thus, by truth,—-beyond the world’s wide walls 105 5

mocritus, Pythagoras, Epicurus, Heraclitus, Anaxi· but Philolaus, one of the earlier disciples of Pytha-
