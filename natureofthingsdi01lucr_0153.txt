THE NATURE OF THINGS.

PARENT of ROME ! by gods and men belov’d‚

Benignant VENUS !' thou! the sail-ciad Main,.

 

thought the objection too puerile to be noticed, for
he certainly has not adverted to i't. Tycho Brahe
was likewise consulted upon the same subject, in
1596, by Is. Pontanus, who defended our poet with
much dexterity and success. See Lettres publiees
par M. Malthaeus‚ ἐι Leide, 1698, 8vo.

The Bai-on de Contures has also offered an inge-
nious vindication. He denies this introductory part
of the poem to be mythologicah and contends that
the whole is pure and allowable allegory z that Venus,
in the sense here adopted,⁴ is a mere symbol of uni-
versal generation; and Mam, her paramour, of uni-
versal destruction: from the embraces of which two
opposite powers proceed the regeneration, re-com-
bination, and re-dissolution of all things ς upon which
doctrine the whole system of Epicurus is founded.
Mr. Hume, however, who has likewise engaged in a
short critique upon the same subject, is not disposed
to be so easily satisfied. He admits that Venusmay
possibly, in this introduction, be allegorically ad-
dressed, and that Lucretius, as a philosopher, had a
right to addi-ess her ‘⁶ as the generating power which
‘⁶ miniates, renews, and beautifies the universe ; but
⁴‘ he was soon betrayed,” continues our critic, ‘⁶ by

⁸⁴ the mythology of his age, into incoherencies, while

False to his creed, he paints the loves of Mars.
Now, allowing that the solution cf De Coutures is
somewhat too recondite, I can by no means perceive
the incoherency complained of by Mr. Hume. The
charaeoer of Mars is, in the present instance, altogether
as allegoric as that of Venus3 and the fiction of their
union as correct and consistent with the true spirit of
assegory, as any fiction that was ever invented. Ve-
nus is the poetic type of all female grace and excel-
lence3 Mars, of all the qualities of the hero: the
one the goddess of beauty3 the other the genius of
war. What is there then incoherent in the loves of
such ideal personages 3 in their mutual embraces ; and
the triumph of the former over the latter? The same
fact is realized every day in the natural world. It is
the very type of the connexion between Alexander
and Thais, Mare Antony and Cleopatra, our own
Edward and Eleonora. That such an allegory was
consonant with the mythology of the Grecian people,
