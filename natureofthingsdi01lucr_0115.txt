THE LIFE OF LUCRE'I'IUS. ci

moved to Mytelene, and, last of all, to Patre, near Corinth. Here,
from the suavity of his manners, the inhabitants unanimously conferred
upon him the fieedom of their city. Hc settled, therelbre, among them,
and adopted, a short time before his death, a particular friend of Cice—

death. Quintus was barbarously beheaded, along with his son, in
his own house at Rome, to which he had privily returned for pecu-
