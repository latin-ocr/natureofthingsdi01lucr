BooK 111. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 437

The sou] is mortal, this the mind includes: 435

Such their joint bond, their close connexion such.

First, having prov’d‚ then, this attenuate power

From subtlest atoms rear'd‚ minuter far

Than those of water, smoloe, or buoyant nn‘st,

Since much in speed it conquers, and, by force 440

Far less, is rous'd to action—for full oft

E’en the faint phantasms of such forms alone

The soul excites, as when, in deep repose,

The fragrant altar nnokes, and vapours rich

Rise to the view—a sense, no doubt, indue'd 44 5

From the light phantasms of substantia] forms

Floating around us—this already prov'd‚

Judge next, since lymph when bursts th’ inclosing vase,

Flows at each fracture, since fugacious smoke,

Since Vapours vanish into viewless air, 4 50

Judge how the soul must dissipate amam,

How sooner perish‚ and its primal seeds

Speedier dissolve, when once the flesh they quit.

For since this flesh, the vase the soul that munds,

dem est quasi vas, aut aliquod animi receptaculum.''
“ Study then thy mind, for the body is but, as it
were, a vessel, or receptacle of the mind.'’ Blair, in
his “ Grave,’' a poem that, amidst much low and
coarse imagery, as well as much negligence of style,

is frequently invigorated with bold, and enlivened'

by novel conceptions, has a passage to the same
effect:

body and soul must part.
Fond couple! link’d more close than wedded
ρων.

 

This wings its way to its almighty source,
The witness of its actions, now its judge:
That drops into the dark, and noisome grave,
Like a disabledpitchcr of no use.
