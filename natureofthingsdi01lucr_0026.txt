xli PREFACE.

But it is impossible to show Lucretius whole and entire in a prose
translation ot' any lzin‹l; and to exhibit him merely as a philosopher,
and not as a poet, is to rob him of by far the greater portion ot his
merim—of that which is peculiarly his own. For, whatever may be
the value wc affix to his doctrines and scientific inductions, the splen-
dour of liis ixnagery, and the harmony of his numbers are still infi-
nite! y inore valuable. The t1·anslator’s animadversions upon Creech are,
unquesfionably, well fo.unded; yet the unfavourable opinion he has
expressed of the English language, proves him to be but little ac«
quaintetl with its extent or flexibility. Of itself, and without a recur-
rcnce to abstruso or technical ternis, it possesses a vocabulary suffi-
cientlv varic-d and rich for all the common purposes of science and lite-
rature ; yct the present day affords ample proofs that under the plastic
hands of ajudicious poet, the most recondite terms of the learned lan-
guages may be introduced into it with elegance, perspicuity, and melo-
dy; nor is it possible, perhaps, to instance any modern tongue with
which they will so harmoniously amalgamate as our own.

ln 1799, another effort was made to introduce THE NATURE OF
TniNos in an English dress, by an anonymous author, who presented
the first book alone as a specimen ofhis abilities for this purpose. The
sainplc thus offered was in lambio rhyme, and the rest of the poem
was to have followed, as soon as the public had testified its approba-
tion of the attempt. Without obtrusively ‹lepreciating the talents of a
contemporary writer, it is sufficient to observo, that nothing farther of
this version has been heard of; that the (lecision of the public was
unt'avourable3 and that the author appearS, in consequence, to have
submitted, with suitable modesty, to the tribunal to which he appealed.

1⁴6 results then, from this general survey, that no translation of
'run NA'runr. or 'fumos has hitherto been presented to the public
