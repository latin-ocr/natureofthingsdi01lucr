THE NATURE OF THINGS.

343

Springs single, the sole progeny produc’d,

The sole sustain’d3 still countless every class,

Those, chief, percipient: the wild, mountain-herds‚

The race of man consociate, the mute fish

With quiv’ring fin, and all th' aerial tribeS.

Hence, too, nor heav'n, nor earth, nor sun, nor moon,

Nor the broad main, nor aught besides, alone

Can live, but each unlimited in kind.

Each the same substance, the same seeds of death,

Bears in its fmme, that stamp the ranks diverse

More obvious, gender'd by connubia] love.

These truths avow'd, all nature shines at once,

Free in her acts, no tyrant to control,

Self-potent, and uninfluenc'd by the gods.

For O, ye powers divine! whose tranquil lives

Flow free from care, with ceaseless sun-shine blest,—

there is no such thing as chance, (upon which subject,
see the preceding life ofLucretius,)and that there cer-
tainly exists an unknown and unsearchable Being‚ to
whom even the gods themselves are subject, and who
exerciseth an unresisted authority among the inhabi-
tants of the earth ι

A Powrzrt uuxnown, who, from his awful,
shades
O’erturns all human grandeur! treads to dust
Crowns, ensigns, rodsl—-the proudest boasts of
state! ‘
And laughs at au the mockery of man !
Boox ν. 1260.

This inscrutable being Epicurus represented as
enjoying all immortality‚ and beatitude : at his mere
will and command, the heavenS, the planetS, and all
the phaenomena of nature were produced ; and to him
he exhorts that mankind cense not to address their
prayers and adorations. See Appendix to the life of
Lucretius. This sublime passage has been hitherto
totally misunderstood, and, of consequence, totally
misinterpreted‚ by all the commentators upon our
poet, whom Ihave yet met with, whether in Ita-
lian, Freneh, or English, who have uniformly, and
with unpardonable indolence, followed each other,
and represented their author as an absolute atheist.
