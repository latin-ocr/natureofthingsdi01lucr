-APPENDIX cxxix

the cardinal Polignac, whose name is well known in the rcpublic of
letters, produced a Latin poeni of nine Books in hexameter verse, of
no small degi-cc of inerit, which he entitled ‘⁶ Anti-LucrethiS, sivo (lc
Deo ct Naturae? from which title it is obvious, that thc aim
of thc cardinal was chiefly directed against 1110 modern (lisciplcs of
Epicurus: but, whatever might hc its success, and how well soci-cr
such success might bc deserrcd against other philosophie resormch,
neither poetry nor prosc had any avail in this instance. The dia-
lectics of the schools had yicldcd to the novum organon of the inunortal
Ba00n3 syllogistic logoinachics to an attentive examinatior] of nature ;
the Epicurism of (jasscndi was embraced by thc most eminent mo-

* This celebrated poem, we learn from the Eloge of M. de Boze, as also from the preface prefixed to
the first edition, took its rise from mere accident. During a short resident-e of the abbe Polignac in
Holland, in the year 1697, he formed au acquaintance with the learned Peter Bayle: whom he was astO=
nished to find attached to the system of Epicurus, and delighted with the poem of Lucretius, which he
appeared to have completely committed to memory. The abbe found this system was gaining ground very
considerably among men of letters, and immediately determined on opposing it by a poem of an op-
posite tendency. On his return, therefore, to the quietude of his own home, hc composed one in five
books, which he entitled Anti-Lucretius. This formed the rudiments of the future and more perfect
work, which extended to nine, and which added, to the attack upon Lucretius, an additional assault upon
the doctrines of Spinoza, Hobbes, Newton, and even Locke himself. Polignac was about forty years
old when he commenced this undertaking ε he proceeded with it very slowly‚ reading it, as it advanced, to
Malbranche‚ and a great number of other literary friends, both before his electiori to his cardinalship, and
afterwards, during his residence at Rome: but, perhaps, no poem, after all, has had so many escapes
from being bun'ed in oblivion. The cardinal himself was forty years at work upon it, aud at length died
at the extreme age of eighty, leaving it still unfinished ; and 111 such a confused state, from the variety of
additions aud alterations he had made in it, that it was attended with the utmost difficulty, in many in-
stances, to trace its connection. His friend the abbe Rothelin, however, to whom on his death-bed he
entrusted his indigested papers, undertook the Herculean task. At this task he laboured occasionally for
several years, and, at length, died himself as hc was on the point of completing it. This was an addi-
tional evil, from which the poem did not recover for a long time ε finally, about the year 1746, nearly
half a century after its commencement‚ it was ushered into the world by M„ de Beau, Professor of Elo-
quence in the University of Paris.

This poem is certainly possessed of very considerable merit : its Latinity is, for the most part, correct,
though by no means equal to that of Buchanan or Casimir; its order is perspicacioris, and its similies, in
general, appropriate. Its principal defects appear to be inanimation and extravagance of system. The greatest
injury it sustains is from its title : the author, in this respect, should have been more modest : by him-
self, he is certainly instructive, fertile, and elegant; but he has no pretensions to enter the list with Lu-
cretius—A very good French translation of this poem was given in prose by M. de Eougainville, perpe-
maleecretary of the Royal Academy of Belles Leti res in 1750,
