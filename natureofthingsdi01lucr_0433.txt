13001111‘. THE NATURE OF THINGS. ⁸8oe

Full many an atom, each, of shape unlike.
Thus fire itself is complex ; for if nought
Deep blend besides, the germs, at least, combine
Of hear, smoke, ashes, and translucent light :
And reas'ning thus, thy vig'rous mind may deem 690
Still pow’rs beyond lurk deeper though unknown.
Oft the same substance, as the fragrant gurns
Burnt o’er the altar to th' offended gods,
Emits both taste and odour, hence from seeds
Educ’d, of various figures3 odours oft 695
Piercing the nerves that tastes essay in vain,
And tastes where odours fail : facts that evince
Their forms diverse ; and prove that seeds unlike

Rear the mixt mass diffus'd through all that lives.—

Mark but these· fluent numbers; many a type 700
To many a term is common ; but the termS,
The numbers cull’d‚ as diff'ring these from those,
From different types evolve : not so diverse
That the same type recurs not through the whole,
Or that, remrring, it recurs alone 705

From types too bounded 3 *but from types alike
