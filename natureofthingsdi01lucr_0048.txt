xxxiv THE LIFE oF LUCRETIUS.

Lucretius, it is u‘cll known, maintained, through the whole of their
lires, the entire system thcy had inibibed at Athens : and, when Brutus
was alarnicd by the appearance of a ghost, while sitting alone in his
tent at inidnight, and revolving in his own mind the meditated attack
upon Anthony and Octavius, Cassius quickly dispelled his apprehen-
sions, by recalling to him the opinion of EpicuruS, upon phantoms of
this description; which, like the iniages that appear to us in our
dreams, he assured him were nothing more than mere films, or efflu-

ences ejeetcd from surrounding objeets, and only presented to the
mind in a state of extreme quietudo and abstraction ἢ

It is not to be supposed, that a body of youths, thus richly en-
dowed by nature, and instrueted by education, would remain deaf to
the voice of ambition, and evince no desire of sharing in those politi-
cal honours and emoluments, which the situation of the commonwealth
afforded them, at this period, so fair a chance of attaining. For
the most part, they plunged deeply' into the stream ; many of them
indeed far beyond their depth,——yet to all it proved a boisterous cur-
rent, and they were frequently in danger of being overwhelmed.
Ambition and self-intcrest appear, on particular occasions, to have se-
dueed several of then] from the path of political reetitude and inte-
grity; but, upon the whole, they may be uniformly regarded as the
brightest ornaments of their country, and the firmest pillars of her
republican constitution. They were a band not easily to be broken ;
and the instances are but few, in which they separated from each

other, and appeared in opposite parties. Memmius waS‚ on more

Brutus is stated, by some authors, to have imbibed the entire system of Stoicism; and there can be no
doubt that he did so, with respect to its ethical doctrines. But on points of physics and metaphysics‚

the readiness with which he yielded to these arguments of Cassius, proves obviously, that he was not far
from being still an Epicurean at his heart.
