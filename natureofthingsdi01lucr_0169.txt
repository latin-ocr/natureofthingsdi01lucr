THE NATURE OF THINGS.

21

Unfold th' immortals, and their blest abodes:

How Nature all creates, sustam, matures,

And how, at length, dissolves ; what forms the mass,

Term’d by the learned, Matter, Seeds of Things,

And generative Atoms, or, at times

55

Atoms primordial, as hence all proceeds.

Far, far from mortals, and their vain concernS,

In peace perpetual dwell th’ immortal Gods:

Each self-dependent, and from human Wants

orders of angels and archangels. Respecting the es-
sence of these angelic beings Lucretius seems in some
measure undetermined. In Book V. 154, he repre-
sents them as totally uncompounded of matter, and
consequently incapable of either affecting or being
affected by material bodies, from the want of some
common property.

For their immor-tal nature far remov'd
From human sense, from matter gross and dull,

Scarce by the mind’s pure spirit can be trac’d.
ἔ* ἡ ²ss ᾖ

And, thus, th’ immortal regions must from ours
Wide vary, congruous to their purer frames.

Yet in Book vi. 77, he obviously intimares, that
by profound meditatim-1, and abstraction from the
world, the solitary soul may attain some slender
knowledge of the essence of these pure spirits; and
imbibe some portion of their tranquillity and happi-
ness. He asserts, in various places, consistently with
the doctrine ofspecics or effluences developed in Book
iv- that effigies of these divinities are perpetually
flowing from their personS. In Book v- 1192, he
expressly declares that mankind, in the commence-
ment of the world, before the mind was distracted by
an infinitude of cares and occupations‚ traced these
effigies not unfrequently amidst their solitary musings,
and were conscious of their presence in their midnight
dreams. And he informs us, in many places, that

Epicurus was much accustomed to such religious ab·
stractions; and that by such abstractions he became
divinely illuminated. The wh'ole system, indeed,
bears the most obvious resemblance, as I have before
observed, to that of Milton in his Paradise Lost, ex-
cepting that Lucretius, far from assigning to his di·
vinities the superintendance of the planets, represents
them as totally unaffected by every transaction that
occurs. For a farther account of this system, the
reader may consult the prefixed life of our poet.

Epicurum however, was not the only philosopher
of ancient Greece who admitted the existence of such
an order of secondary gods as is here referred to.
Plato allowed the same, and apparently to a much
greater extent in point of number. Like Epicurus,
moreover‚ he conceived that, although they were the
production of the supreme and ineffable principle,
they were at the same time sels-existent, and inde-
pendent.r Between the two propositions, of creation
and seIf-existence‚ there seems indeed to be no small
degree ofdiscrepancy: but how far the attributes of
self-existence and independence may be bestowed οη
any order of created beings‚ by the Creator himself,
it is not perhaps for our limited capacities to ascer-
tain completely. It is sufficient to observe, on the
present occasion, that several of the Greek philoso-
phers appear to have imagined that it was not only
possible but actual.
