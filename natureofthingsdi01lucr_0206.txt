DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. 1·

Postremo, pereunt imbres, ubi eos pater AEther

In gremium matris Terra’i praempitavit ε

At nitidae surgunt fruges, rameique virescunt

Arboribus 3 crescunt ipsae, fetuque gravantur.

Hine aliter porro nostrum geum, atque ferarum:

255

Hinc laetas urbeis puerum florere videmus,

Frundiferasque novis avibus canere undique sylvas ε

Hinc, fessae pecudes, pingues per pabula laeta,

Corpora deponunt 3 et candens lacteus humor

Uberibus manat distentis ι hinc nova proles

Ver. 287. When, on the bosom ‘ff maternal Ean-r rr,
His showers redundant genial ETHER pours‚]
The beauty of this passage needs not be pointed out
to any one. ln the personification of the poem,
ether lias always been allotted a masculine, as the
earth has a feminine gender; and the productions of
nature have been regarded as the [ruits of their con-
nubial embraces. Virgil has imitated our poet,
Georg. ii. 325; and “ he strives hard,” observes
Dr. wauton, ‘⁴ to excel liim3 but I am afraid it can-
*‘ not be said that he bas done it.”

Tum pater omnipotens foecundis imbribus AEther
Conjugis in gremium laetae descendit, et omnes
Magnus alit, magno commixtus corpore, fetus.

Ether, great ‚lord of life, his wings extends,

And on the bosom of his bride descends,

With showers prolific feeds the vast embrace,

That fills all nature, and renews her race.
Soa-HEBY,

The idea is common among the Greek poets3 and
it is more than probable that if Virgil borrowed the

above stom Lueretius, Lucretius himself had a re-

ference to the following verses, in a fragment of
Euripedes: .

Ερω μεν ομςμου Γαῖ ὅτ’ αν ξηρον nudor,

ΑκαρΤῙΟῚ θἰυχμω, ›073305 52:354& ἔχη·

Epa δ’ ὦ σεμνᾶς Ουρανος, πληρουμενος

Ομςρου, ’mam εις focum, Αφροδιτης dvm

‘07' αν δε συμμιχθῆτον εις ταυτον δυο,

Tan-iove.» ἧμιν ‘nawa xan‘rfespoug' ἅμα,

Οέεν Βροτειογ ζη τε, και Sama, ’γεγος.μ

Earth loves the shower, when, parch'd with sum=
mer-beat,

Her barren womb no genial moisture knows ς

And genial Ether lovea, with showers distent,

On her soft lap to fall in dalliance sweet.

From the fond union that createS‚ at once,

And nurtures all things, man himself proceeds,

Augments and ripens.

Tasso has unquestionably an allusion to this passage
of our poet, in his Jerusalem Delivered; and his de.-
scription is highly beautiful·

La terra, che dianzi afflitta ed egra
Di fessure lc membra avea ripiene,
