- DE RERUM NATURA.

L113. ΙΙΙ.

Res animi pacem delibat tempore in ullo.

At contra nusquam adparent Acherusia templa3

25

Nec tellus obstat, quin omnia despiciantur,

Sub pedibus quaequomque infra per inane geruntur.

Hiis ibi me rebus quaedam divina voluptas

Percipit, atque horror; quod sic natura, tua vi

Tam manifesta patens, ex omni parte retecta est.

30

Et, quoniam docui, cunctarum exordia rerum

Qualia sint, et quam, variis distantia formis,

Sponte sua volitent, aeterno percita motu ;

Quoque modo possint res ex hiis quaeque creari:

Hasce secundum res animi natura videtur,

 

Ver. 2 5. With laughing ether, ] So Chaucer,
in his description of the ruddy morning:

And firie Phebus rysith up so bright
That all the orient laughith at the sight.
CANT. Kmoi-{T's TALE. v. ¹495·

But Casimir, with a still closer resemblance ε

Dum ridet afr, et supinas

Solicitat levis aura frondes. Ad Tnsrun.

While ether laughs, and wanton airs
Kiss the young leaves the poplar bears.

Ver. 31. a sublime ἅεΙζξΙπ,
A sacred horror sways me—] Nothing ean
be more awfully grand, or seriously impressive. In
the original, it occurs thus ε

 

Hiis ibi me rebus quaedam divina voluptas
Percipit, atque horror ς

Marchetti has, most unfortunately, exchanged the
term horror for stupor, surprize‚ astonishment ; a very
different feeling from that expressed by the former
terms, and far less dignified :

35

 

ond' io mpirmi
A te mi sento da cotal divino ,
E diletto e stupor.

Creech has entirely omitted this latter passion,
and hereby destroyed more than half the beauty of

the picture, unless he meaned to express it under the
term silently, a term, however, which does not exist
in his author z

From thoughts like these, Ι mighty pleasure find,
And silently admire thy strength of mind.

But, what is more extraordinary still, even the
prose version of Guernier has said as little upon the
subject as Creech, and less than Marchetti : “ a cer-
tain divine pleasure,’' says the translator, “ spreads
around me, and I stand amazed, that by thy strength
of mind,” δίε. This is to give a prose version of
Creech, and not of Lucretius.

The union of terror and joy is by no means un-
common, and is hence often represented upon ade-
quate occasions, by writers duly attentive to na-

ture-
