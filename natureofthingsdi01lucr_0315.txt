THE NATURE OF THINGS.

Dissolve all tie, and leave to transient rest

The common matter whence each substance springs.

Hence must incalculable seeds exist

Ceaseless in act3 and the vast whole derive

Alone from boundless matter impulse due.

But Hy, O MEMMIUS, fly the sect deceiv'd,

property of weight and gravitation ? whence comes
it to pass, moreover, if it be a general law, that all
material bodies must press to such central point, that
air and fire oppose this general law, and fly off in
stubborn disobedience ? more especially, whence pro-
ceeds it, that fire should be able to pierce through
every stratum of the incumbent and clastic atmos—
phere itself‚ and defy its constrictive bond? for such
was the opinion of the Stoics, who imagined that the

sun, moon, and stars‚ were fed by this perpetual and
lambent pabulum.

These are the questions with which our poet per-
plexed his adversaries, and the objections he urges to
their system. And though a deeper investigation of
the lawsof nature have, at present, rendered some of
his quei-ies nugatory‚ and afforded us ample means of
replying to others3 yet the opponents of Lucretius
were without these advantages‚ and-do not appear to
have been possessed of any power of rebutting the
difficulties with which he presses them, or of extri-
cating themselves from the dilemmas into which they
must have been perpetually thrown,

The opinion of the Stoics‚ however, respecting
both the universe and the solar system, as to their
moving around, aud tending towards some common
centre, is corroborated by modern observations. The
common centre of universal nature, in the opi·
nion of Dr. Hersehell, consists of a mass of opake
and chaotic matter. Philos. Trans. Vol. LXXXIV.
from which he thinks it probable that all the sys-
tems of the Universe have been omitted by some
strong projeetile force, not dissimilar to the sudden ex-
plosions which frequently take place in volcanos and
earthquakes. See note on b. ii. 1170, and b. v. 425.

This doctrine of the Stoics is of considerable anti-
quity. Homer alludes to it, and represents the com·
mon centre of the universe as the place of punish-
ment for the disobedient deities. Here he fixes his
Tartarus, or Hell ς and, in the name of Jupiter, de·
nounces to every refractory god, that

he, far from steep Olympus thrown,

Low in the dark Tartarian guls shall groan ;

As deep beneath th’ infernal ceu-ru hurl'd,

As from that ceu-ran to th' etherial world. Pors.

This passage has been imitated by Virgil ς but, as
a story seldom loses any thing either by report or
transcription‚ the latter has taken care to double the
distance between heaven ancl hell ; and in the AEneid
it runs thus :
tum Tartarus ipse

 

B1s patet in praeceps tantum, tenditque sub umbras,
Qantus ad aethereum coeli suspectus Olympum.

The gaping gulph low to the centre lies 3
And TWJCE as deep as earth is distant from the

skies. Dum Ν.

We cannot be surprized, therefore, at Milton's
beating both the Greek and Roman poets; and in-
forming us that the regions appointed sor Satan
were

As far remov’d from God and light of heaven,

As from the eentre Tunica to tb' utmost Pole-
