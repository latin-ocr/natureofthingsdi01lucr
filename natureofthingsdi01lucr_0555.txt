Boox ΙΙΙ. THE NATURE OF THINGs 405

All that the sight marks instantaneous most.

But what thus rapid moves, from seeds must spring 195
Most exquisitely subtile, and rotund,

Rous'd into action by minutest force.

Thus moves the fluent stream, urg'd on with ease,

Since rear'd from atoms polish’d, and exile,

While the tough honey, of compacter frame, 200
More tardy flows, and ampler force demands.

For more tenacious here the total mass,

From beavier seeds engender'd, tenuous less,

And less globose. Thus zephyr's gentlest breath

Wide scatters, oft, the seeds the poppy ream, 205
Heap’d in the sun-beam‚—while the grosser mass

Of congregated stones‚ or missile darts

F eels no impression. Hence material things

Move brisk or sluggish, as from atoms rear’d

Light and globose, or denset, and more rough. 2 10

Since then the mind, in every act, we trace

Most voluble, from seeds of subtlest size,

the movements of the body. 1t cannot change its Human Understanding, in which he found it neces-
place, for it has none: its residence is not in loco, sary to introduce several sections in opposition to it,
but ubi. This metaphysical mystery continued to be in order completely to expose its absurdity, that it
a favourite maxim in all the schools till the latter end was by any means banished from the systems of seho-
oflast century. Even Des Cartes contended for the lars and metaphysicians. See Essay on Human
truth and accuracy of the position: and it was not Understanding, Book 11. chap. xxiii. sect. 18, 19,
till the publication of Locke's celebrated Essay on and 20.
