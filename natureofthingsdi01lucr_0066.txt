lii THE LIFE OF LUCRETlUS.

the consciousness a man may have of the rectitude of his own inten-
tion, and the truth of his own tenets, nothing is so difficult as to era-
dicate ancient and national prejudices, and, more especially, preju-
dices that relate to an established religion which necessarily creates
many of the first offices of the govermnent that establishcs it. This
was precisely the situation of Lucretius, when he first ventured upon
his poem. The popular religion was the grossest and most iniquitous
that can be conceived; and every unbiassed mind must agree with
him that it would have been better for the people to have had no re-
ligion whatever, than to have been in the belief and profession of one
that subserved almost every species of vice, and could be accommo-
dated to the purposes of every party, and every plot. This popular
religion, moreover, as I have just observcd, formed an essential part
of the constitution of the republic, as well as proved a source of its
most lucrative offices and employments. During the monarchy of
Rome, the king himself, in this respect resembling the monarch of
our own country, was the pontifex maximus, or supreme head of the
chui·cl1’³'÷: and when, upon the expulsion of the TarquinS, this office
existed no longer, the people, at the instigation of Junius Brutus,
appointed a Rea* Sacrorum ᾧ, or lord of religious cereinonies, to be for
ever elected from the Patrician order, and to have a supreme control
over all the countless ranks of curiones, flamines, flaminicae, vestal
virgins, augurS, celeres, salii, and whatever classifications besides were
included in the sacred system of NUMA· It should be noticed, how-
ever, that this economy of the church was at all times kept totally dis-
tinct from the civil department of the state ; and that neither the chief
pontiti himself, nor the augurs, nor any person possessed of any reli-
‹rious office whatever, was suffered to interfere in the concerns of the
panem but that each was compelled to devote himself solely to the
care. of the public worship, and his own peculiar function ἶ.
