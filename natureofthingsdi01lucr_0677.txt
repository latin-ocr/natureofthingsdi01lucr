ΤΗΕ NATURE OF THINGS.

Thousands, moreo'er‚ like him of crowns possest,

Have fall’n like him, and all their pomp resign’d.

E'en he who wander'd o’er the mighty main,

Led on his legions, and first op'd the way

1065

To tread on foot th' unfathom’d gulphs below,

He who thus brav’d the billows, and the storins,

Has clos’d his eye-fids, and his soul resign’d.--—

Sermo, the war's dread thunder-bolt‚ the scourge

Of ransack'd Trms, sleeps, like the slave, inhum’d.

1070

Add, too, the founders of the graceful arts‚

And schools erudite 3——add th’ immortal bards;

Add HOMER’S self the muses’

subito in Hispania extincti occidissent. “ When the
two thunder-bolts of our government, Cn. and P.
Scipio, suddenly died in Spain.''

Hence Voltaire, in his description of Henry the
Great, on his abrupt landing in France, after his vi-
sit to Enghnd, by which he fortunatelyjoins his

troops, at the moment of their retreat :

Brillant comme l’sclair au fort dt la tempete,

Il vole aux prtmiers rangs, il s'avance {1 leur tete 3
Il commu, 011 le snit, il change les desrins,
Lasondre est dans ses yeux, la mort est dans ses

mains. HENRlADE, ch. iv.

The reader may accept the following version ε

Fierce as the thunder-bolt through tempests spe-eds,
He flies, he joins them, and the foi-emost lenda 3
He fights, inspires, the power of fate commauds,
Lightm'ng his eyes, and ihavoc ir. his hands.

ΜΓ. Mickle has introduced something of the same
image into his translation of the Lusiad :A

VVhose spear’s dread lightning o’er th’ embattled
plain

Has ost oJerix*he1m’d the Moors. Boox v.

reahn who rules ;

The merit of this simile, however, is all his own ;‘
for it does not occur in the Portugueze‚ which is as
follows:

 

qui os Espanhoes tanto ajudou
A fazcrern nos Nlouros bravo estrago.r

Ver. 1073. Add HOMER’S sefflhe musss' real-n
who rides ;] In the original, “ Homerus
secptra potitus :‘’ which Creech has thus pretended

to tran slate :

Homer, their prince, that darling· of the nine—
ll'ssizs ‘Troy would ιιΙ a sccomljllll 1:¹pinc
'I'a [κ’ thus sung—is nothing now but fame.

Such a paraphrastic rendering can scarcely be
called a version : there is not a syllable of authority
in Lucretius foi· the conceit expressed in the above
verses in italics; and it would certainly have been
unworthy of his judgmcnt. Manilius has applauded
this first and chief of bards in the opening of his se-
cond book, in a style that Lucretius might not have
disdziined ; and the translation of this passage, which
I shall subfix, and which is also from Cre-ech, does
credit to his powers of metrical versmn ι
