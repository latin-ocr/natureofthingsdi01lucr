ΧΚΤΙῚΕΠ with eternity compar’d‚ that state

Which, after death, to mortals yet remains.

Drives us, afra-id! what dangers, and what toils!

Yet death still hastens, nor can mortal man,

With all his efforts, turn th’ unerring shaft.

Nor can it boast one source of new delight.

The bliss we covet seems, at distant view,

To all su peri0r3

It cloys, we spurn it, and another call.

Yet the same thirst of life corrodes us still,

Though doubtful of to—morr0w‚ ancl the fate

T0·morr0w brings—our messing, or our curse.

Young has copied this passageiu :his Ni ght Thoughts,

as he has done many others of the last two hundred

verses of the present book: the copy, however, to

which 1 now refer, is rathera paraphrase than a close

imitation. It has poetic merit and moral excellence;
but is deteriorated by verbal iterations repeated till
they become tedious:

Eehold the picture of earth's happiest man !

He calls his wish, it comes, he sends it back,

And says he call’d another—that arrives,

Meets the same welcome, yet he still calls on,

Till one calls him who varies not his call;

But holds him fast in chains of darkness bound

Till nature dies, and judgmcnt sets himsrec;

A ,si-eedem how less welcomc than his chains .'
