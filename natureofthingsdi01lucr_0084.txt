lxx THE LIFE OF LUCRETJUS.

which perceires and aetnates, should be present in these bodies, even
in the midst of their infirmities, and not be present in so grand, so
excellent a movement of nature: unless, indeed, such a Pownn be
to be denied for the sole reason that it is not seen, οι· pereeived3 as
though we were able to behold this mind of ours by which we de-
termine, by which we foresee, by which, at this moment, I lnyselfact,
and speak, or could plainly ascertain of what it consists, or where it
resides. This, this, then, is Tun Pownn that has so osten favonred
this city with an incredible prosperity and happiness ⁴²²st Let not,
therefore, the theisni ot'anretius be suspected, because, in eonjunction
with his countryinen in general, he represents the great author and ar-
biter of all things as an UNSEEN or INSCRUTABLE Powssn. Even in
'the present age of the world, we only know him from his attributes,—
srom his word and from his works, for no man ῘιαίΙι hitherto seen God,
ον can see him. The sacred scriptures are full of the sanie representation.
⁷Thus, Moses, in the very midst of an intercourse with which he was
favoured by the Almighty, inquires what is his name, that he might in-
form the Israelites of it ἦ To the same effect, Zophar, in his inter-

view with J ob :

Canst thou by searching find out God?
Canst thou completely find out the Almighty 1 ?

With which, the following sublime apostrophe of Job himselfis in
perfect unison :

ὅ Nec vero quisquam aliter arbitrari potest, nisi qni nullam Vm esse ducit, Numsnvz Divinum—Est,
est profecto illa Vis; neque in his corporibus, atque in hac imbecillitate nostra, inest QMDDAM, quod
vigeat et sentiat, et non inest in hoc tanto naturae tam praeclaro motu; nisi forte idcirco esse non putant
quia non apparet, nee cernitur3 proinde quasi nostiam ipsam mentem, qna sapimus, qna providemus, qua
haec ipsa agimus, ac dicimus, videre, aut plane, qualis, aut ubi sit, sentire possumus. Ea Vis, ea igitur
ipsa, quae saepe incredibiles huic urbi felicitates atque opes attulit. Sect. xxx. xxxi. p. 630. Edit.
