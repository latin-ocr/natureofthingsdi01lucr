The lovely IPHIGENVIA, round she look’d,——-

THE NATURE OF THINGS.. 27

Her lavish tresses, spurning still the bond

Of sacred fluet, flaunting o’er her cheeks‚——-

Qmm staret aras ante tristis victima,
Jam destinata virgo, purpureum decus
Per alba fudit ora virgineus pudor,
Coetus viriles intuerier insolens ς

Ut si quis Indum purpura violet ebur,
Rosasve niveis misceat cum liliis.

Sed se per ora cum pudore fuderat
Perspicua certe juncta vis fiduciae,
Interque flentes sola fletibus carens,
Metu remisso constitit firma, ac sui
Secura fati z quas tenebat lachrymas
Propinqua morti virgo, populus non tenet.
Alium parentis beneficium recens movet.
Et servitutis patric exemptum jugum, V
Et solitudo familiae clarissimae.

Alius acerbam sortis ingemuit vicem,
Longoque luctu, breve redemptum gaudium,
Raroque stabilem rebus in laetis fidem.
Florem juventae deflet ille, et siderum
Similes ocellos, aemulamque auro comam,
Supraque sexum pectoris constantiam>
Et forte solito gratiorem afflaverat
Natura honorem, ceu supremo munere
Dignata funus nobilis viraginis.

Ut jam ruentis aequor in Tartessium
Phoebi recedens esse gratior solet
Splendor, rosaeque vere supremo halitus
Colorque cupidus detinet oculos magis :
Sic virgo fati stat supremo in limine
Parata morti.

As near the altar stood the victim sad,

The destin’d maid,—o’er either cheek so chaste
Spread the wide blush of modesty—unwont
Thus to be compass’d by the throngs os men.
So o’er the iv’ry flows the clear carmine,

So roses oft with snow-white lillies blend.

But, with the virgin blush, spread too the power,
O’er all her visage, of triumphant saith.

Firm stood she, fearleas of her fate ; with eye
Down-cast and tearless 3 tearless she alone

At this dread hour, while all around her wept.

Some urg'd her sire's heroic deeds of late,

Our country freed from bondage by his arms,

Himsels now childless, and his iace extinct.

These sigh’d‚ full deep, o’er fortune’s cruel course !

How short is bliss, though bought with endless
grief l

How all unstable every joy of man ἔ

While those her flower of youth deplor’d——her eyes

Radiant as stars, her hair that rivall’d gold,

And the firm courage that her sex excell’d ε

While happly Nature, with superior charms

Had thus endow’d her at the last sad hour,

To prove how fair au offering she could boast-

As seems the sun more precious, when at eve

His last look trembles o’er the western waves,

And sweeter smells the rose, and lovelier far

Unfolds its blossoms, when the spring retires:

So on the threshold of impending fate

Stood she, prepar'd for death.

The best dramatic piece I have ever met with, de-
rived from the same source, next to this of Buchanan,
is Racine's. It is modelled for the modern stage, and
has often been exhibited with success. Euripedes is
the entire source from which the French poet has
drawn his characters. He has considerably, how-
ever, changed that of Achilles 3 but the piece derives
no benefit from the alteration. With the former, the
Grecian hero is neither a lover of Iphigenia, nor has
ever entertained an idea of marrying her. A report
to this effect is indeed determined upon, in a council
of the Grecian chiefs, at which Achilles was not pre-
sent, but merely to obtain the consent of Clytem-
nestra, the mother of Iphigenia, to her daughter's
being conveyed to Aulis 3 where both the ladies,
agreeably to the directions sent them, arrive shortly
afterwards3 and, on meeting with Achilles, accost
him in the character they conceived he was sustain-
ing. A mutual and excessive surprize succeeds z for

Achilles had not even heard of the stratagem b5
