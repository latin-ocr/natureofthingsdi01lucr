ideas thence resulting ;- there is no such thing as causation, no proof
ofidentity, none of a God. Yet it would be injustice to assert, that
Mr. Hume hence denied thc being ofa God ; on the contrary, he ad-

Dr. Ilartley, and founded on the doctrine of vibration and the asso-
ciation of ideas3 the other by Dr. Beattie and Dr. Reid, and which
appeals to the decisions of common sense Ἰ.

These responsive theories, however, originating in our own country,
have not satisfied the metaphysicians of the Continent3 and, in rcality,
being principal'ly directed to our own meridian, they do not embrace
all the objectionable points presented by continental hypotheses which
have obtained celebrity enough to require notice. M. Kant has
hence advanced a new system, which has the boast of being of
universal applicati0n‚ and in every respect underived from antece-
dent philosophers: but as this is a system rather intellectual than
material, it by no means falls within the scope of the present lucu-
bration to analyze it. It affects, in a greater degree than any other
theory whatever, to take nothing for granted, and to trace all ideas
