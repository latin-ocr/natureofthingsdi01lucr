BooK II. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 287

Free to each term, yet ever new combin'd,
Flows the vast change, th’ harmonious system flows.
Thus, through the world, the primal seeds of all,
To all things common, re-arrang’d diverse, 710
In myriad forms shoot forth ; and herbs, and men,
And trees umbrageous own the same fixt source.
Yet not in endless modes combine the seeds
Of things at random ; many a monster else
Would start tremendous, the fair frame of man 715
Sprout forth half-form'd, and trunks of trees have souls.
Shapes then would swarm half earthly, half marine,
And Nature’s all-prolific womb propel,
With breath of fire, Chimaeras ; things the sight
Meets never, since from seeds, and pow’rs precise, 720
All spring to life, and thus preserve their kinds.
Thus all must spring, since all, from every food‚
To every tribe adapted, strait digests 3
And, blending with each limb9 the train renews
Of acts appropriate 3 while th’ ungenial mass ’ 72 5

Meets earth unchang’d : or if, perchance‚ absorb’d,

Thus also virgil ε Bulls breathin g fire her furrows ne'er have known.
