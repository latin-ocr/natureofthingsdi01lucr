THE NATURE OF THINGS.

For nought in each subsists of pow’r t' excite

Those sensile motions whence perception flows.

Hence some fourth substance, doubtless, must 'we dcem,

Conjoint existing3 which, though void of name,

Springs from minutest atoms, lightest most

And most attenuate 3 deep-endow’d with power

Of fleetest speed, and hence, that first begets

Those sensile movements that the 'rhime pervade.

This first begets, as form'd from subtlest seeds,

Next heat th' incipient action, vapour 'next

Partakes, and air posterior, till the soul

Rouses throughout: then flows the blood, then feels

corded by Pliny, ii. 68, and Diogenes Laertius, in
Vit. Anaxag. ii. 10. Aristode, in his first book of
Meteorics, supposes these stones to be carried up-
wards from the earth in the course of a violent tem-
pest : και οτε, says he, ὃ εν αι’γος ποταμοις επεσε λιθος εκ

dern times, they are said, by many philosophers, to
sall from the moon: Anaxagoras contended, that
they fell from the sun ,¹ and hence, his disciple Eu-
ripides, in his Fable of phaeton, denominates the

sun, χρυσεᾶν ἕωλον, “ a golden giche-'³

That this was the opinion of Epicurus, we learn

from Plutarch, who tells us expressly that he admit-

ted the existence of these four fluids in the composite

spirit of man. Επικουρος (την ψυχὴν ελεγε) κραμα, εκ

αισΘητικον. De Plac. Phil. iv. 3. Having thus given

a statement of the Epicurean soul or spirit, and its
component parts, it may not be unentertaining to my
readers to be infor-med of the opinions of the Grecian
philosophers in general upon this subject, who have ac-
quired the greatest share of celebrity‚ and whose doc-
trines were bowed to with superior deference. Cicero
will save us the trouble of a deep investigation 3 for he
has enumerated the tenets of thirteen Grecian sages
on the point in question, in the first book of his
Tusculan Qestions. 1. Some, says he, held the
mind to be the heart itself. H. Others, not the
heart, but that it is an undescribable something
seated in the heart. III. Others esteemed it a part
of the brain. IV. Others, that it was not the braxin,
but a something seated in the hrain. V. Empedo-
cles taught, that it was a collection ofblood resident
in the heart. VI. Some, again, held it to bea breath,
or aura. VII. Zeno maintained, that it consisted
of particles of elementary lire. VIII. Aristoxenus,
that it resulted from a general harmony of the sys-
tem. IX. Pythagoras and Xenocrates, that it was
a number. X. Plato, that it wasacompound os three
passions, occupying three distinct scats t 1. Rcason.
