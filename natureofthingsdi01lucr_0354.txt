206 DE RERUM NATURA. Lm. 11.

Convestire sua perfundens omnia luce, '

Omnibus in promptu manifestumque esse videmus.
At vapor is, quem sol mittit, lumenque serenum,
Non per inane meat vacuum3 quo tardius ire 150
Cogitur, a‘e‘rias quod sic diverberet undas:

Nec singillatim corpuscula quaeque, vapores,
Sed conplexa, meant inter se, conque globata:
Quapropter simul inter se retrahuntur ς et extra
Obficiuntur, utei cogantur tardius ire. 155
At, quae sunt solida primordia simplicitate,

Quom per inane meant vacuum, nec res remorae fit

Ulla foris, atque ipsa, suis e partibus unum,

Unum in quem coepere, locum connixa feruntur;

Debent nimirum praecellere mobilitate, 160

Et multo citius ferri, quam lumina solis-3

Perfectly accordant is the following splendid de-
scription of Klopstock‚ in his Messias ;
Hier ftillen ,nur sonnen den umkreis ;
Und, gleich ein hiille gewebt aas strahlen (les urlichts,
Zicht sich ihr glan-2. um den himmel herum. Ges-i.

 

Here only suns the vast horizon fill ;
'Whose intermingling beams a robe qflight
chave that enwraps the bright expanse of heaven.

Not foreign to the same elegant figure, is the fol-
lowing of Tarafa, an Arabim] poet, in his Albecriyyo,
one of the seven metrical effusions which were sus-
pended in golden characters in the temple of Mecca.
He is describing the sair maid, of whom he was en-
amoured. I copy from Sir william Jones, ‘⁴ Her
face appears to be wrupped in a wil of sun-beatus ;
unblemished is her complexion, and her skin without
a wrinkle.''

Ver. 1 5 5. Instant in speech unbounded in his Maza]
This inimitable description of the rapidity of light, is
thus glanced at by Cowley, in his celebrated Hymn
to the same power:

Swift as light thoughts their empty career run-
Thy racc is finished when begun.

And so exact is this idea, to what was meant to be
conveyed by Lucretius, that Creech, in his version of
the Nature of Things‚ has thought he could not do
better than copy the latter line verbally z accordingly,
he has given us for his translation,

How swift the beams of the bright rising sun
Shoot forth ! their race isfinished when begua.
