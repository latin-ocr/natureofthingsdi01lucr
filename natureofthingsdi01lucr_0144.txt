dern philosophers, and at last appears to have obtained an eternal

triumph, from its application, by Newton and Huygens‚ to the depart-

ment of natural philosophy, and, by Locke and Condillac, to that of
metaphysics.

It is useless to pursue this history any further: the systems which
have since been started in opposition to the Atomie, however splendid
and fashionable for the moment, have already flitted away, οι· have
no prospect of obtaining any permaneney. Of these, the principal
is that of the Idealists, of whom the chief leaders were Berkely
and Hume. The former, dissatisfied with Loeke's explanation of the
mode by which sensation is communicated to the mind, incapable of
tracing the connexion between externat objeets and the mind itself, and
consequently the existence of an external world, boldly denied such an
existence, and maintained that sensations and ideas were mere modifi-
cations of the soul, concatenated by a system of laws immutable and
universal ; whence the existence and necessary connexion of cause and
effect, the proof of identity, and the demonstration of an intelligent
Creator. The system ofHume was founded upon that os Berkely ; but,
instead of restraining, it extended it to a still more extravagant length.
Hume,in imitation of Berkely, contended that the externat world was
incapable of proof; that the mind or soul was nothing more than a
conseiousness of existe-nce, and that such conseiousness depended alone
on a succession of ideas produced either by sensations or impressions:
bnt he maintained exclusivcly that he could no more traee any neees-
sary catenation between such ideas 01· sensations, between one event
and another, than he could trace the existence of externa] objects. Facts,
he admitted, conjoined with facts, but are not necessarily connected
with each other ; and hence to assert that such connexion was pro-
duced by a system of operative laws, was, in his opinion, to presume‚
but by no means to reason. Upon this theory, therefore, there is no-
