With respect to Plutarch and Cicero, it must be confest, however,
that they not only knew that the popular prejudice against Epicurus
was without foundation, but occasionally acknowledged it to be so ᾗ.

Iret him, then, who accuses Epicurus of illicit pleasurCS, examine

ton, produce his dishes. Let him enter into his garden, let him sit
down at the sumptuous table it cxhibits, and when convinced by the
banquet itself, let him rise up and pronounce his condemnation †·.
The epistlcs which Epicurus occasionally addressed to his friends, and
which were afterwards collected into one volume, contained a state-
ment of his daily regimen. These unfortunatcly are now no longerss,

ἶ The destruction which has thus attended the works of Epicurus, compel us, 111 quoting from him, to
have recourse to Subsequent authors, who, like Diocles and Diogenes Laertius, have preserved certain
parts of his writings in their own composition& These, indeed, are but few, yet sufficiently numerous
