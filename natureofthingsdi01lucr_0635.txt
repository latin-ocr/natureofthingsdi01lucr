The health exterior, and since many a blow,

Aim'd at its powers, discomfited recoils

the closest conjunction between them, but continues
to maintain, that their essences are not the same,
which he endeavours by various analogies to illus-
trate, but more particularly by the union subsisting
between the musician and his instrument. From the
unity and simplicity of the intelligent principle, he
deduces its inimortality3 and finally conteres, that
every other system is incompatible with the idea of
moral liberty. These argumente, and their illustra-
tions, form the basis of the fit‘th book of the Anti-
Lucretius. But the author still perceived that much
remained to be accomplished 3 for his opponent had
obser-ved, that sensation was not the property of
man alone, but of every class of the brute creation as
well: that these, therefore, were also possessed of
sorus, or a sentient principle ; and that, as, with re-

He first observes, ver. 344, that the vulgar belief
of the existence of a soul in brutes, is extremely
doubtful. “ Perhaps,'' says he, “it is true: Ι will

our senses. Yon conjectu1'e,'' continues he, ver.

In reply to this, however, it is obvious that no
