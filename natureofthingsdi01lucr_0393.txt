THE NATURE OF THINGS. 245

This if thou doubt, the rouen shall quick decide.

For Toucu, O rouen l ye powers of heav'n supreme!

ToueH forms the genuine sense whence chief we trace

Springs up innare, injurious in th' escape,

Or, like the genial tide by Venus rous'd‚

figure (those, doubssess, of elementary cold) are more
closely compressed together, whether resident in the
water itself‚ at the time, or absorbed from without,
and thus united to the water.'' κατ’ εκθλιῴιν μεν του πε-

Des Cartes has made a large use of this doctrine of
Epicurus, in his theory of the creation of the world.
For though hc contenda, contrary to the Epicuream,
and indeed, the more modern Newtonian creed, for
the infinite divisibility of matter3 yet he finds himself
under the necessity of supposing that its first ele-
ments were thrown by mutual occursion and coneus.
sion into atoms of three grand orders or divisions:
globules, or spheres of a larger dimension, globules
of a smaller dimension‚ and particles of ajagged, or
angular shape z and he appropriates a similar use to
each of these orders of elementary atoms with our
poet in the subject immediately before us. From a
junction of the minuter globules, proceed the lightest
and most liquid bodies in nature3 from an union of
the larger, those less liquid and volatile3 and from
the hooked and angular particles‚ those that are most
gross and difficult of motion. See this part of the
Cartesian theory more fully explained in the note on
b. v. v. 528.

Ver. 437. Unlike indanted, ] Dissimili dentata
modo. Indented, or armed with teeth. This term, which
was occasionally applied by Latin poets to any thing
that could puncture or lacerate, or irritate by its acri-
mony, has, nevertheless, been more frequently used
to describe the effect of severe cold, or frost. Thus
Horace :

 

Matutina parum cautos jam—stigma mordent:
SAT. ii. 6.
Now bite the morning frosts the unprepared.

In the same manner, in our own language, we use
the phrasesfivst-bitten‚ a cold hiring wind, &c. Thus,
Shakspeare :

 

Here feel we the icy placing,

And churlish chiding of the winter's wind ;
Which, when it bites, and blows upon my body,
E’en till I shrink with cold, I smile.

Ver. 438. For rouen, O rouen, ye powrrsof
heav’n supreme Ι

ΤουεΗ forms the genuine sense, &c.] The term

touch, like simple perception, appears applicable to

all the senses; but even in its appropriate and more

restrained meaning, our poet may bejustified in his

eulogy‚ in 'consequence of its being a sense extend-

ing universally over the body, and not confined, as

are the senses in general, to one individual organ.
See note on ver. 341, b. i.

Faber has, unwarrantably‚ objected to this apostro-
phe, which, observes he, may be a poetic, but, certainly,
is not a philosophie illustration, and, least of all, an
illustration after the manner of Epicurus. Upon
this subject, however, and in express contradiction to
Faber’s opinion, Eusebius has justly observed‚ that
‘⁶ Epicurus was accustomed to indulge in similar
apostrophes‚ or exclamations to the supreme powers,
in all bis books ; binding himself by the most solemn
oaths3 and invoking t'ne gods in almost all his dis-
courses.'' ορκους Se και &pnes-mue ,uvfmvi τοις ἑαυτου ,[5ιὲ-
