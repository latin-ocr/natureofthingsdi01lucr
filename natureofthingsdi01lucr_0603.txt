BOOK 111. THE NATURE OF THINGs. 453

As sensile motions fits them best t' excite :
Such as, at death, when mixt with vacant air, 580
'Twere vain t' expect, of all restraint devoid.
For air itself must body first become
Compact and vital, ere the secret soul
Its pores can tenant, or those motions urge,
Urg’d, during life, through all the sentient frasne. 58 ς
Hence doubly flows it why the soul and mind,
One in themselves, of body when disrob'd,

Like smoke Hies total, every seed disperst?
And that th' external frame thus sinks defil'd
In putrid death, since froni their wonted posts
Urg’d off, through every passage, every pore, 595
Press the percipient seedS, from every limb,
From every membrane o'er the system spread?
