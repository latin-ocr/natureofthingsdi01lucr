This verse has given great offence to many of the
commentators, who appear to have been incapable of
separating the idea of the immortals, whom our poet
supposes to exist, like the angels or archangels of the
christian system, in the possession of all felicity, but
nevertheless as secondary powers alone, from the idea
of one etei-nal and intelligent Fir-stCause. Lanctantius,
therefore, bursts forth into the following‘animadver-
sion upon what he erroneously conceived to be its
tendency: Dissolvitur autem religio si credamus Epi-
curo illa dicenti. De Ir. Dis. 8. “ All religion
“ vanishes from us the moment we credit this pro-
“ position of Epicurus.'’ But, independently ofthis
conception relative to their blessed or immaterial
spirits, the Epicureans never believed that the Deity,
or great First Cause himself, at any time, interfered
with the moral world; since such an interference
would, in their opinion, have been at once subversive
of ,the free-agency of the mind, and have reduced
mankind to so many passive machines. Epicurus,
says a writer who was well versed in his system,
taught, that whatever relates to moral actions, God
never atrempts to controul, but only what relates to
the nature of the physical world z και Επικουρος ἓέ xx?

example.

Sotto religion grave e severa.

And much odium has been thrown upon the·Roman
bard, for the impiety he is here supposed to exhibit.
But without minutely entering at present into the
theology of the Epicureans, itis obvious, from the
instance he shortly afterwards adduces‚-that, I
mean, of the sacrifice oflphigenia,—that the religion
to which he immediately adverts is the superstitious
tenets and practices that were popular among his own
countrymcn, and the pagan world at large. And
surely there could be no impiet-5· in ridiculing such a
senseless mass of religiones this ; since atlieism itself
must have been sar less impious than the doctrines
it inculcated.

It is but just, however, to observe that Evelyn
