THE LIFE OF LUCRETlUS. lxxv

little we do know, appears to be so loose and indefinite, that we have

no satisfactory datum from which to draw a conclusion. The present
day itself, and even the Christian chureh, is not without espousers os
the same doctrine: nor were the Hebrew theologians uniformly free
from attachment to it. The short narrative of the creation given by
Moses seems to leave the question undecided, as he evidently speaks
proleptically‚ and intimates the existence of matter in a chaotic state
anterior to the formation of the world; consistently with which, the
authorof the Book of Wisdom asserts, in the most express manner pos-
Sible, that ‘⁶ tlte almiglety leand of the Lord created tlie world out qf we·

Moses in Genesis i. l, implies, of itself, an absolute creation out of
ozotlzing; and that Origcn‚ who followed the same opinion, objected to
the above proposition contained in the Wisdom of Solomon, as issuing
from a book which is not universally admitted to form a part of cano-
nical scripture. Philo-52, however, as well as the greater partos the
Christian fathers ss, are well known to have coincided in the sentiment
expressed in the latter book; and Justin hlartyr'directly affirms it
to have been the common belief of his own aera, that the Creator of
the world formed it out of ‘zwifizslzioned matter ξ ; in which respect, says
he, Moses, the Platonists, and ourselves‚ are all agreed, ‘⁵ that the
whole‘ world was created, by the word of God, out of plastis: matter,
(as asserted by Moses‚) Plato and his adherents affirm, and ourselves
have been taught to believe Η.” The grand motive for such a dogma
appears to have been a supposed absurdity in concciving that any
