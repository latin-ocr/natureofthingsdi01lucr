beginning, in the creation of the universe, that they inflexihly fulfil

blished liturgy, the scriptures themselves, are not free from such ex-
pressions, We well know, that in these latter they are to be taken
in their popular sense alone3 Epicurus expressly tells us, that they
are thus only to be understood under his own system; and in com-

mon justice, as well as common sense, we ought not therefore to un-
derstand them otherwise.

But it may be said, that Epicurus contendcd sor the eternity of
matter. He (lid so; yet this is a doctrine which by no means exclu-
sively attaches itself to the Epicurean school. PerhaPS, if closely in—

It is probablc that Piscator had his eye directed to this passage of Epicurus when he wrote the fol.
lowing, which is perfectly in unison with it. “ In consideratione mcteorum, ut tonitrui, fulguris, pluviae,
nivis, ventorum, non debemus subsistere in investigatione causarum secundarum, et naturalium, sed mentes
