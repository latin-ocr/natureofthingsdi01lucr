DE RERUM NATURA.

Lus. I.

Perpetuo possint aevi labentia tractu3

Nec prorsum facere, ut restet minus ire, meando:

Usque adeo passini patet ingens copia rebus,

1005

Finibus exemptis, in cunetas undique parteiS.

Ipsa modum porro sibi rerum summa parare

Ne possit, natura tenet: quia corpus inani,

Et, quod inane autem est, finiri corpore cogit3

Ut sic alternis infinita omnia reddat,

1010

Aut etiam, alterutrum nisi terminet alterum eorum

Simplice natura, ut pateat tamen immoderatum3

Nec mare, nec tellus, neque coeli lucida templa,

Nec mortale genus, nec divom corpora sancta,

Exiguum possent hora'i sistere tempus.

years,
Nor yet arriv'd in sight of mortal things.

 

Lucretius, admitting the lection of the Leyden
copy, tells us, on the subject of space, that '

o'er its broad realms
Immensum-ed, and immeasurably spread,

 

⁷ From age to age resplendent light propels,

In vain, its ssight perpetua13 distant still

And ever distant from the verge of things.

Cowley has a strong and sublime idea, in some
measure approaching this of Lucretius and Akenside,
in his Davideis; and which Johnson has inserted in
his Life, as an instance of vigorous conception.

He is descanting on the kingdom of the Messiah :

Round the whole world his dreaded name shall

¹ sound,
And reach to worlds that must not yet befound.

Such are the casual reoemblances, the parallel scin-
tillations of men of bold and energetic genius.
