THE LIFE ΟΕ LUCRETffls. lis.

in cxistence3 but Diogenes Laertius, who, in his age, had an oppor-
tunity of perusing them, and has preserved several in the course of
his biography, tells us, from what 116 had read, that his diet was 1110
most temperate imaginable: that he satisfied himself with the 1161113
of 1113 gardei] intermixed with fruits, and the plainest pottagc. “l
am perfectly contented,'' said Epicurus, 111 0116 of these epistlos, ‘⁶ 111111
bread and water alone3 but send me a piece of your Cyprian 6116636,
that I may indulge mysclf whenever I seel disposed for a luxurious
feast.'’ Such, adds Diogenes, who has preserved the anecdote, was
the life of him who declared that his pursuit was plcasure ⁷²². And
it is observed by Diocles, that his disciples followed the example of
their preceptor: that water was their common beverage, and that they
never drank more than a small cup of wine. When Demetrius, there-
fore, besieged the city of Athens, and the inhabitants were reduced to
the utmost extremity, the schol-<irs of Epicurus sustained the common
calamity, with less inconvenience than any other citizens: the philo-
sopher supported them at his own expence, sharing with them daily a
small ration of 1113 beans »κη

“ Ι readily,'’ says Seneca himself, in one of his epistles, ‘⁶ quote
the excellent maxims of Epicurus, that Ι may convince those, who de-
ceive themselves as to their object, and expect to find in such maxims
a screen for their vices, that, to whatever sect they attach themselves,
they must live virtuously. This is the inscription over the garden-gate1
‘⁶ Here, stranger, mayest thou happily take up thine abode; here plea-

manner in which every part of it has been unfolded by Lucretius, it is rather to be welcomed as a curi-
osity alone, than as containing any new matter of essential importancc.
