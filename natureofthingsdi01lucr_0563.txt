THE NATURE OF THINGS.

mortal from its resurrection. That the power of the
Deity is able to support its existence in a separate
and gaseous, or etherialized state, and to continue to
it the property of personality‚ no one has a right to
deny, till he can prove that the exercise of such a
power implies a contradiction. That a possession of
the common organs of the body is not absolutely ne-
cessary for the production and renovation of such a
spiritualized system, we may form some conjecture
from the fact, that many animals, well known to us
at present, and whose powers of irritability and sen-
sation proceed alone from the possession of oxygo-
nous and galvanic aura3‚ are totally destitute of those
organs which, in other animals, appear absolutely re-
quisite to their productim, and derive them from
other means. Thus, insects in general, even those
which, like the fire-fly and glow-worm, are capable
of secreting light, have neither lungs nor beart, and
receive the vital gasses through the pores ofztieir
skin : while the polypus, and in fact all the zoophy-
tic order, have neither beart, brain‚ stomach, nor
viscera of an)¹ description, but an individual cavity‚
or tube alone, for the purpose of vital and sentient
organs. There are, again, many other animals both
aqueous and marine, which have no brain‚ although
they have a heart and lungs3 while the leech is not
only destitute of brain‚ but of nerves of every kind 2

class, the entire instet, in the course of its very brief
duration‚ undergoes not less than three distinct me-
tamorphoses. From an egg it becomes a worm,
from a worm an aurelia, from an aurelia an active and
ae'rial fly. Its organs experience an equal variation,
and receive and separate ¹the vital gasses in an equally
different manner; yet the animal itself continues the
same, and loses nothing of its personality. Other
equally curious instances might be enumerated, if
necessary3 but these are sufficient to prove, that a
system of sensorial power, and, consequendy, of per-
ception, volition, and action, resulting from a combi—
nation of vital auras, may exist without the possession
of those organs which, at first sight, appear abso-
lutely essentia} to such existence ; and we may hence
form some idea of the etherial texture of the soul,
the “ celestia! body which God giveth it‚” to adopt
the triumphant words of the apos-tle, 1 Cor. xv. 38,
40, when, freed from the flesti, and dropping its ac·
customed organS, it defles the power of death, and
enters upon a state of separate existence.

These observations I have thrown out, however,
rather as hints towards a future theory, than as a
theory actually formed and insisted upon ; as I have,
also, the preceding resemblance between the a'c'rial
gasses of the Epicureans and of mod= ru chemists, as
a matter of curiosity, rather than from any idea of
derogating from the claims of later periods‚ or a pre-
tension that Lucretius was acquainted with some of
the most important discoveries of our own age. It
is sufficient to have proved, that Epicurus and his
followers contended for the existence of gasses most
singularly similar to t'nc caloric, the oxygem the gal-
vanic aura of the present day. We must not, how-
ever, indeed we cannot, suppose, that the Greeks
were unacquainted Wltll chemistry‚ though they had
