The scheme falls 'sels-destroy’de-For then, must seeds 980
Hold pow'rs adverse ς and laugh, and shake their sides,
While tears of anguish down their cheeks distil.

Come, now, and mark perspicuous what remains.
Obscure the subject: but the thirst of fame
Burns all my bosom3 and through ev’ry nerve 98 5
Darts the proud love of letterS‚ and the muse.
I feel th’ inspiring power3 and roam resolv'd
Through paths P1ER1AN never trod before.

O Muse ! of yore who, when LucRE‘nus sung By poet never “od before,

Manilius has a few verses to the same effect : In these untrodden paths to sacred fame·

By mortal else untrod.

I first approach, with numbers unessay'd,
Oblations bearing, borne till now by none.
