THE NATURE OF THINGS.

471

If still thou deem through all this frame diffus'd,

Then, since diffus’d, much surer must it fail ;

710

For what thus flows diffusive, must dissolve,

And perish, doubtleSS, forc'd through every pore.
As vanish foodS, through every mazy gland,
Through every limb when urg’d, to different forms

Converting gradual, so the mind, the soul

715

Howe'er entire, when first the flesh it meets

Dissolves by junction ς for through every sluice,

Through every organ intricate and fine,

Must percolate its atoms, sever’d hence,

And decompos’d,—-and hence the base alone

720

Of that which after sways th’ external frasne.

Thus must the soul a natal day possess,

And final grave, an origin and end.

F ly, too, at death, the soul's pure seeds entire,

Or with the body are there still that rest Ρ

abditaque intus
Spiramenta anime lethali vulnere rupit.

AEu. ix. 579.

 

The forceful spear with mortal wound sinks deep,
And drives the soul through all its latent pores.

Ver. 724. Γζγ, too, at death, the soul's pure seeds
enare,

Or with the body are there still that rest ?]
Doctor Priestley, and some other materialists‚ seem
to have conceived‚ in order to account the better
for persona! identity and responsibility, in a future
state, that the few elementary atoms that compose

725

the cmbryon and incipient frame of every man, ad-
here to him through life, continue undis3ipated
in his grave, and will again constitute an essentia!
part of him at the resurrection. This idea, however,
is so repugnant to all the known and admitted laws
of animal being, that it cannot be supported for a
moment. It is allowed by all physiologists‚ that
every atem of the human body is perpetually‚ though
imperceptibly, wearing away, and its place supplied
by fresh atoms introduced in the form of food;
and that hence, in process of time, every man is,
as to his physical frame, a being altogether different

from what he was formerly, having no one corpuscle
