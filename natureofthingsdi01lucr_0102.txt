yet nothing but an evolution or augmentation, a mere change and
increased organization, are sufficient to produce this new and higher
power. It is precisely the same with animals. The fecundated egg
ofa hen, 01· 011101· bird, when first laid, is as destitute of all irritabi-
lity as the acorn of an oak-tree3 the mother nourishes it with 11001, and

Such appears to be the clear indication and gradual progress of na-

whole of his doctrine. He pursued the mind into her inmost recesses;

he analyzed her powers, and endeavoured to develope her very tex-
