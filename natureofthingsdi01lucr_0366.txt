DE RERUM NATURA.

Lus. ΙΙ,

Nec foret obfensus natuS, nec plaga creata

Principiis ; ita nihil umquam natura creasset.

Quod, si forte aliquis credit graviora potesse

225

Corpora, quo citius rectum per inane feruntur,

Incidere ex supero levioribus, atque ita plagas

Gignere, quae possint genitaleis reddere motus ;

Avius a vera longe ratione recedit.

Nam, per aquas quaequomque cadunt atque ae'ra deorsum 2 30

Haec pro ponderibus casus celerare necesse est:

Propterea, quia corpus aquae naturaque tenuis

Aeris haud possunt aeque rem quamque morari3

Sed citius cedunt, gravioribus exsuperata.

At contra nulli, de nulla parte, neque ullo

235

Tempore, inane potest vacuum subsistere rei3

Quin, sua quod natura petit, concedere pergat.

Omnia quapropter debent per inane quietum

AEque‚ ponderibus non aequis, concita ferri.

Ver. 230· Is then, there be, who dcem the seeds eff
things] Nothing can be more true to the phi-
losophie facts and experiments of the present day,
than the reasoning and observations of our poet, con-
tained in the passage extending from the present to
ver. 247. And it is truly astonishing to observe
how accurately he has anticipated the gravitation of
Newton, and the decisions of Boyle upon the air-
pump. It is a palpablc error, observes he, to sup-
pose that bodies, falling in a perfect vacuum, differ
in the degree of their velocity ; such difference pro-
ceeding entirely from the variation of the density or
tenuity of the medium through which they move,

and the solidity of the moving body.—Thus‚ in the
exhausted reeeiver of an air-pump, a guinea and a
feather, one of the beaviest‚ and one of the lightest
bodies we are acquaintcd with, descend with equal
rapidity‚ or, as our poet most accurately expresses it,

in equal time
Through the blank void, unequal weights descend
Of every fancied variance.

 

Gravity, observes Sir Isaac Newton‚ equally af-
fects au bodies, without regard either to their bulk
or figure, and- exists in proportion to their quantity
of matter3 so that all bodies consist of matter equally
