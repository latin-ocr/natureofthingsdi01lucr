DE RERU M NATURA.

Lm. ΙΙΙ,

Jam triplex animi est igitur natura reperta:

Nec tamen haec sat sunt ad sensum cuncta creandum;

other gasses have alternately been glanced at, as af-
fording the chieffomes of this recondite and attenuate
power. Electricity has been principally studied with
this express view ς and the study has, at length, been
crowned with a success, which, though by no means
perfect, opens to us, perhaps, the way to perfection-
In consequence of the experiments of Cotugno‚ Vas-
sali-Eandi, Galvani‚ Volta, and many other cele-
brated philosophers, it has ultimately been demon-
strated, that animals are capable of generating or
exciting an electric aura in their own bodies, as well
as of receiving it from without3 that this electric
aura is possest of all, or nearly all, the properties of
common or metallic electricity‚—but that it acts in a
manner somewhat different; whence, from Μ. Gal-
vcani, oue of its most successful investigators, it has
been denominated‚ by way of distinction, Galvanism‚
or galvanic gass: that it is a volatile and instanta-
neous fluid, apparently propagated through the
uervcs, and operating upon them exclusively; and
what it is the immediate cause of all muscular motion
aad sensation. To recapitulate the experiments by
which these results have been ascertained, would re-
quire a quarto volume instead of a li1nxted note:
many of them, however, have excited so much po-
pular attention as to be already known to most of
my readers, and the rest may be easily collected

mitted ; and hence, like caloric and oxygen, it com-
monly enters into the system in the act of respiration,
and forms a constituent part of the calor ventusque
vitalis referred to by our own poet. But it is un-
certain, whether it thus enter in a state of pure gal-
vanization‚ and is merely propagated through the
blood to the brain, or whether it reach the brain in a
more concrete form, and be secreted by this eurious
and enormous gland from the common mass of the
blood that passes to it through the carotid arteries.
The experiments and observations which have hi-
therto been made, are considerably more in favour of
the latter, than of the former opinion. In conse-
quence of this important discovery of a sensitive‚ or
galvanic gass, the Lavoisierian theory of respiration
has itself been subject to some doubts, and various
new hypotheses have been started in its stead‚ or ra-
ther, perhaps, various amendments have been
attempted ; among which last I shall briefly
mention, that much of the power formerly attribut-
ed to the oxygenouS, has been transferred to the
galvanic aura; that the cells of the lungs are con-
ceived to be galvanic organs, and that animal heat is
rather hence derived and propagated, than from the
absorption of caloric.

[nto these differences I cannot enter: it is suffi-
cient for me to have pointed out, that the vital spirit
of our poet seems to have been established by the ex-
periments of modern chemistry, and that it results
from a peculiar system or combination of various in-
finitely volatile and attenuate auras obtained from the
:itmosphere in the act of respiration, and existing,
like the grosser fluids and organs themselves, by a
continuity and catenation of supply. lt should, un-
questionably‚ appear from analogous facts and experi—
ments‚ that a seul, thus constituted, must necessarily
perish with the body 3 and it is not to be wondered
ax, therefore, that our poet should have strenuously
entertained such a belief. But, be the soul what it
may, the Christian scriptures teach us the contrary :
they unfold to us, that the soul is immortal from its

birth3 as they do also, that the body shall be im·
