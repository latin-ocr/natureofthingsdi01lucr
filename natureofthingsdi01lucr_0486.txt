round the central tire. With a conjecture, thus bold
and accurate, thus capable of leading on to the full
developemcnt os the grand and total fact itself‚ it is
astonishing that mankind should have suffered them-
selves to have remained, for more than two thousand
years afterwards, the dupes of system after system,
alike unsatisfactory, perplext, and even inapplicable :
more especially when we reflect that, according to
his own confession, it was this happy conjecture of
the earlier Pythagoreans that, first ofall, gave Coper-
nicus himself the idea of that theory, which he so
thoroughly unfolded, and by which he has so justly
immortalized his name. Aristarchus, the Samiam,
indeed, as we are assured by Archimedes, revived
the doctrine of Philolaus, about a thousand years
after its first invention, but with an unaccountable
want of success ,

The first geometrical idea that appears to have
been entertained of the world at large, as most co—in-
cide-nt with sensible appearances, was that of an im-
mense but irregular plane, encircled on all sides by
a bouudless expanse, out of which the celestial lurni-
naries daily ascended, forming an arch over the at-
mosphere by their quotidian path, and siuking every

even imagiued: but when once this latter opinion
began to prevail, it was easy to conceive the exist-
ence of celestia} spheres. The sun, the moon, and the
planete, had now, therefore, three several spheres as-
signed thern for their habitations; and the stars were
supposed to be fixt‚ like genis, to the concave surface
of an immense crystalline shell, which embraced the

curred, were very incompetent to an explanation of
the whole, aud other spheres were hence conceived‚
and added to those already acknowledged to exist.
And so considerable were the multiplications of
spheres bestowed on the heavens by Eudoxus, Cal-
lippus, Aristode, and Fiacastorio, that they amount-

ed, in the era of this last philosopher, about two cen-
turies agn, to no less a number than seventy-four:
and the oven-loaded hypothesis became as intricate
and inexplicable as the heavens were imagined to be
themselves. The embarrassment was felt, and it was
attempted to be relieved by another and a more ar-
tificial system, that I mean of Epicycles and Eccen-
tric Circles. This, which was the original invention of

Apollonius, received its last improvements from Pto-
lemy ; from whom it has, in general, derived its
name. In this system, the spheric motions were still
continued, but every luminary‚ whilst revolving in
its own orb, was supposed to have the centre of its
orb carried at the same time round the circumference
of another circle. By the introduction ofthis theory,
several difficulties were undoubtedly removed; but
multitudes still remained3 and to obviate these was
introduced the contrivance of the Equam, or Equal-
izing Circle. For a more full and particular ac-
count of which, as also for a more complete his-
tory of the whole of this branch of natural philo-
sophy, I refer the reader to La Place's System de
la Nature.

This system of Ptolemy‚ or of Epicycles and Ec-
centric Cir-cles, continued, after its invention, till the
new theory ofCopernicus‚ introduced in the sixteenth
century. Copernicus was highly dissatisfied with
the thcory in general use ; its complications were
most perplexing‚ and its multifarious corrections fa-
tigued the imagination : nor did it solve half the diffi-
culties which were perpetually arising. He resolved,
therefore, with patient investigation‚ to examine all
the different theories aud conjectures on the same sub-
lime subject‚which had ever been entertained by philo-
sophers, or of which any account could be traced.
He, at last, arrived, as I have before observed, at the
opinion of some of the first disciples os Pythagoras,
respecting the revolution of the earth in the ecliptic :
and from this moment he resolved to make this con-
jecture the basis of a new theory. Instead, therefore,
of continuing motion to the sun, he resolved to con-

ceive of the sun as a permanent body ς and instead of
