Boon 111. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 455

That through the total body lives the soul,
And e'en in body severS, seed from seed, 600
Ere thence expell'd‚ and scatter’d into air?
E’en during life the fractur’d soul seems oft
From force abrupt half-hurried from her home3
Each vital function failing, and the face,
As though in death, all pallid, chang’d, and wan. 605
Such the deep swoon evinces, when within
Sinks the faint spirit, and each prostrate power
Pants for its final doom. Such then the force
That mind and body oft alike unnerves
Tha, but the least augmented, death ensues. 610

Can, then, the soni, thus impotem: of frame‚

When once disrob’d‚ abandon’d, and expos’d‚

Through the wide air, to every boist’rous breeze,

Can it then triumph, dost thou firmly deem,

Not o'er all time, but e’en one moment live? 615
Nor do the dying e'er the soul perceive

Rush out entire, when exil'd from the heart,

The bronchial tube first filling, then the throat‚

And mouth successive ; but at once it faiis

In its own region, as each sense alike 620

Fails in its destin’d theatre of power.
