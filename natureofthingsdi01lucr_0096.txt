lxxxii THE LIFE OF LUCRETIUS.

page of human history, that the same ternis were employed with the
same laxity os meaning by the prophet Daniel. Thus interpreted,
scepticism is driven from her last, and inmost sortress3 every subterfuge
is annihilated, and the word and work of the Deity are in perfect uni-
son with each other. That the Creator might have produced the
whole by a single and instantaneous effort, is not to be denied 3 but, as
both revelation and nature concur in asserting that such was not the
fact, it is no more derogatory to him, with whom a thousand years
are but as one day, and one day as a thousand yearS, to suppose that
he allotted six thousand years to the completion of his design than
that he executed it in six days. And, surely, there is something far
more magnificent in conceiving the world to have progressively attain-
ed form, order, and vitality, from the mere operation of powers communi-
cated to it in a sta-te of chaos, or unfashioned matter, than in sup-
posing the actual and persevering exertions of the Almighty for a de·-
finite, although a shorter period of time ⁸4.

That Epicurus and his disciples disbclieved a future state, is a fact
that I pretend not to deny. WVhence were they to acquire a know-
ledge of this important doctrine? The evidences offered in its favour
by nature, and the reflection of our own minds when directed to mo-
ral considerations‚ are, at best, but feeble and inconclusive3 and if
the Jews themselves, the only people at this period who were saroured
with a revelation of any kind, hesitated upon this mysterious subject,
and the Sadducees, a large and considerable body of them openly re-
jected it; if solomon himself, renowned through every aera as the pro-
foundest sage of his nation, believed that the wise or righteous man died
even as the fool or the wieked †·; that ‘⁶ that which befalleth- the sons os
men befalleth beasts, even one thing befalleth thenn as the one dieth
so dieth the other; yea, they have all one spirit3 so that a> man hath
no pre-eminence above a beust, for all is vanity : all go unto one place ;
