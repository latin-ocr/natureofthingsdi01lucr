THE NATURE OF THINGS.

317*

Thus all things change to all things: foliage, fruits,

And the gay glebe to Hocks, and herds convert3

And flocks, and herds to man3 and man, in turn,

885

F eeds the foul strength of birds, and barb'rous beasts.

From every food, thus nature's chemic pow'r

Builds up the forms of life3 in every class

Thus wakes the senses every class avows 3

As through the winter-stack full oft she spreads

ἱ The rushing blaze, and turns the whole to fire.———‘

Seest thou not hence, then, of what -vast concern

The modes in which primordial seeds combine,

Act, or re-act, give motion, or accept?

This creed what hinders ?

what perverts thy mind, 895

And locks thy senses from a truth so plain

That sentient things from things insensate How ?

What but that stocks, and stones‚ and earth's dull clod,

by innumerable re productioris, during innumerable
centur-ies of time, gradually acquir-ed the εἷκε,
strength, and excellence of form and faculties‚ which
they now possess; and that such amazing powers
were originally impressed on matter and spirit, by the
great Parent of Parents, Canae of Causes ξ Ens
Eritium !'’ Additional notes to Temple of Na-
ture.

This theory of spontaneous vitality has been, how-
ever, expressly controverted by Redi, the father of ex-
perimental entomology‚ as well as by Trembley and
Bonnet. But the general force of the argument ad-
vanced by the Roman bard does not depend upon its
truth or falsehood. The fact remains the same,
though the mode of accounting for it be different. It

is equally true that

 

into life th‘ insensate dung-hill rears

 

The racc os worms:
WVhether we believe they spring equivocally from or-
ganic inolecules, swarrning throughout the putrid
and fermenting substance ofthe dunghill ; or that this
latter affords nothing more than a proper nidus for the
deposition of the fecundated eggs offlics and worms,
which, in process of time, are hereby thrown into
action, generatea new organization‚ and produce the
new power of sensation. For no one, I apprehend,
will contend that the eggs of the fly or worm, when
first deposited, are possest of more sensation than the
substance of the dunghill itself; and, thus which
theory soever we imbibe, the position of Lucretius
follows equally as a truth, '·

That sentient things,-things void of sense create.
