DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. 1.

Huc adcedit, uti sine certis imbribus anni

Laetificos nequeat fetus submittere tellus 3

Nec porro, secreta cibo, natura animantum

195

Propagare genus possit, vitamque tueri:

Ut potius multis conmunia corpora rebus

Multa putes esse, ut verbis elementa videmus,

Quam sine principiis ullam rem existere posse„

Denique, quur homines tantos natura parare

Non potuit, pedibus quei pontum per vada possent

Transire, et magnos manibus divellere monteis‚

these refreshing and scasonable showers “ the sweet
influences of Chimah ;” or, as it is rendered
vu the Septuagint‚ and thence borrowed into our
[nglsh version, ‘⁶ of the Pleiades.'' The constella-
tion Chimah (27093) ansv.·ers to the more modern
rign Taurus, as Chesil (502) does to Capricorn;
aud the alternate seasons of spring and winter, the
τεὼ-31 and destruction of the world, are hence beauti-
fully alludzd to : Mazm-oth (ΠἹἿῘΙὯ) is, in all pro-
bability, the zodiae at large ; and Aish (ἄγ’) Arc-
turus, oue of the most remarkable stars in the northern
{1e1nispherc‚--and hence, hy an elegant synecdoche,
employed for the northern hemisphere itself. See

this subject more minutely examined in the note on
book ii. verse 1105 of the present poem. The Greek
translators, however, not being positive as to the term
Mazaroth have, in this instance, and in this alone, re-
tained the Hebrew lection3 in which conduct they
have also been ⁴followed by the translators of the Eng-
lish version. I cannot avoid noticing‚ in this place,
the absurd argument ofthat biblical blunderer Thomas
Paine, deduced from these two verses, to prove the
invalidity and spuriousness of the whole book of Job.
Finding these Greek terms in the English version,
and apprehending, from his gross ignorance of the.
original, that the same Greek terms occurred in the
Hebrew, he has ventui-ed to assert that this book
could uever have been written originally in Hebrcw5
that it must have been first of all compiled, in a much
later period than is generally contended for, by some
romance-writer of Greece, ari'd afterwards translated
from the Greek into the Hebrew mugire, from
