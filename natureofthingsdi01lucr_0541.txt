THE NATURE OF THINGS.

That which controls‚ which measures sentient life,

Forms of this morta] make a part as clear

generally of late, have regarded the whole mass of
the b'rain as equally constituting the mental presence-
chamber; or, in other words, as being equally con-
tributory to the production of sensorial power. Hence
it was maintained by Dr. Priestley, not only that the
brain at large is the grand sensorium, or residence of
the mind, but that the quantity of intelligence‚ in
every instance possessed, depends upon the quantity
of the brain compared with the bulk of the respective
animal: and Dr. Soemefing, a German physician of
considerable ingenuity‚ pursuing the same idea, has
attempted to prove, by a variety of observations and
experiments, that the degree of intelligibility is al-
ways in proportion to the bulk of the brain compared
with that of the nerves ς the comparison, in both in-
mances, accounting for the superiority of intellect in
man ε while Dr. Gall, of Vienna, whose lectures on
cranioscopy were lately suppressed by the emperor of
Germany, as supposed to be derogatory to various
doctrines of the Catholic religion,at th'e same time that
he apprehended the entire brain to be of equal and es-
sential service in the production of general intelli-
gence, imagined also that different portions of this
prodigious viscus are appropriated to different pas-
sions and affections, and that the excess of such pas-
sions and affections vias in proportion to the inordi-
nate bulk of those parts which engendercd them ε
whence he conceived the idea, that by collecting a
considerable number of human sculls, and especially
of those remarkable for any very prominent quality of
the mind, he would be able, from the comparative
indentations or impressions which such appropriate
and augmented compartments of the brain must ne-
cessarily have excited in the bones of the cranium in
their earlier and infantine softness, to determine the
precise divisions of the brain, in which every affection
and passion was generated ; and vice versa, from no·
ticing, in the living subject, the prominency which
such luxuriances or excesses had produced in the
form of the cranium, to carry to perfectiori the art of
physiognomy, and ascenain the ruling passion and

degree of intelligence of every man, upon his first
appearance.

To examine the merits or demerits of these va-
rious conjectures, in the present place, is impossible ;
and I hasten, therefore, to observe‚ that however
widely the idea may be propagated iu modern times,
that the brain is the ehief seat of the mental func-
tions; it cannot be more general than the belief in
former periods, that the powers and affections of the
mind depended primarily upon the heart. So com-
mon indeed was this latter conception for a long pe·
riod, and so deeply imbued with it is every exist-
ing language, that ourselves, and every other nation‚
still continue to ascribe to the heart, in popular and
colloquial dialect, every virtue and vice, every debased
and exalted feeling.

It only remains for me to observe‚ that, as Epi-
curus conceived the entire soul to be material, con-
sistently with what nature and experience point out
with regard to every other material substance, he
also conceived it to be corruptible, and of course,
that it perished with the body. A divine and glo-
rious revelation has since taught us, however, what
we could have been taught by nothing else, that
matter is not necessarily corruptible in any state of
organizati0n; that the corruptible body itsels {hall
hereafter put on incorruption, and death be swal-
lowed up of victory. Such being, therefore, the fu-
ture and indubitable privilege of the material body,
there is no reason why, even from its birth, such
may not be the privilege of the material spirit ; upon
which subject, I have already remarked at large, iu
the life prefixed to the volume before us. Such an
idea, however, whether relating to the soul or the
body, could not readily suggest itself, either to Epi-
curus οι· Lucretius, or the suggestion must have
been instantly renounced‚ as inconsistent with the
dictates and phaenomena of Nature. Left, as they
were, to the cold and comfortless belief, that the
present life is the whole range of being allotted to
mortals, and death the utmost limit and utter ex.
