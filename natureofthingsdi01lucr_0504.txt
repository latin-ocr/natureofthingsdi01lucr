DE RERUM NATURA.

Ipsa dedit dulceis fetus per pabula laeta:

Quae nunc vix nostro grandescunt aucta labore3

Hippocratia : whence, according to Hesychius, Hip,
Hippa‚ Hippia, Hippos, are synonymous with Amor,
which, as just observed, is obviously derived from the
Babylonian Erech, and is, altogether, parallel with the
Egyptian Hip. Even in the Chaldaic vocabulary itself,
wc meet with Bamippa, which is generally interpreted
a barge, ship, or ark, but which, more aecurately,
means the ‘⁶ son, or ‹sffspring of Ippa‚” or the ark,
and may be easily made to apply to Noah, or any of
his family, who were preserved in the maternal womb
of this buc-yant machine. From επ( the Greeks
derived their ’Ἱππ-ος, and a vast variety of modern
lunguagcs, a term of similar import: but without
pursuiug such deductions any farther in the present
case, I shall refer the reader to the note on B. iii.
1048, where the same subject is resumed upon an-
other occasion. I shall here only observe, that the
Egyptian mouth, in which the Nile began to rise,
and the processioni of the sacred ark, or hip, of Isis
to be exhibited, which corresponds with the 23th of
our June, and constitutes the eleventh month in their
simi
01· estu-u which is only a duplication of the radical

calendar, was, in consequence, denominated

9311, omitting the aspirate3 and, as tliis radica] was
applied to sacred purposes, inay be translated, con-
sistently with Oriental costume, “the most sacred
mouth, or season.’'

The Babylonians appear also to have had another
word significative of an ark, which was Bad‚or Boud,
and hence, says Mr. Alwood, the ancient (Βουτος)
Boutus, which was sacred to lsis, or Aphrodite, and
means no other than the city of tre Boni, boat, or
ark. Our own term boat, he derives from this radi-
cal‚ and perhaps the words baut, and about, which
imply a turning round, revolution, or circle, may,
like the word arc, on which I have commented al-
ready, be derived (roni the crescent form of this ma-
chine. Prohably, also, the term (Boi-5115) Botrys, a
city of Phoenicia‚ may be indcbted to the same ori-
gin. But this Bout, Hip, or Ark, was, as I have
'already observed‚ deified and worshipped as the great
origin [ι’ all things: and may we not hence dei-ive

 

the Boodh oi· divinity os the Hindus and Birmans,
the Booden ofthe Ceylonese, and the Oden or Woden
of the Goths; for the Boodh of Hindu is the Dies
Mercurii, Wednesday. or Wodens-day of modern
Europe? This divinity of the Hindus is, by the Sia-
mese, denominated Pomh, or Pood, and by the vul-
gar Poo: whence, probably, again, the Chinesc Fo,
or Foe: but the Siamese denominate their own deity
Cautum, or Gaudma, ternis which, nevertheless‚ ori-
ginate from the common radica] Boodh, or Bout,
and which not only serves as a basis for the Siamese
Gautma, but in all probability for the German Got,
and our own English terms God and good. In rea-
luy, a very little analytical examination will prove
that almost all the names for the Supreme Being‚
both in ancient and modern times, may be traced to
a Chaldaic origin, and had an embryon existence in
Babylonia, prior to the destruction of Babel, and the
disper-sion of the sons of Ham towards Egypt and
Hindustan.

Those I have already enumerated arise from the
name of the ark, or vessel itself, in which the great
progenitors of mankind were preserved in the midst of
the unbounded delinge, and which was afterwards dei-
fied and admitted to divine rites. Yet divine rites were
not only bestowed, in the idolatry ofsucceeding ages,
upon the ark itself, but, as already observed‚ upon
the buildcr of the ark, upon the fabricator, as well
as the fabric. Noah, among the Chaldeans, passes
under the appellation of Thoai, Thent, or Thcuth,
or, as it is written by Herodotus, Xuth: in the ido-
latiy of Babylon, he was deific-d as the supreme god,
the origin of all things, “the father of gods and
men.'’ Hence, Theut, or Tuisto‚ is a father or pro-
genitor in old German, even to the present day:
hence the Taautus of Phoenicia, and the Teutates of
the Celts. Noah, thus deified‚ became the chief di-
vinity of Greece and Rome : from Theuth, or Xuth,
they obtained Zeus (Ζευς) οι· Jupitcr3 from Thoth,
Theos (Θεος), Dios (Διὸς), and Deus :from Zeus (Ζευς)
Zea (Zea), which, by an easy commutability of gen-
der, was, asHesychins informs ns, a title for Venus,
