qualities 011 matter in its most attenuate and evanescent.

This opinion, however, I offer as a speculation to he pursued, ra-
ther than as a doctrine to be preeipitately accredited χ’. Yet its ten-
dency is by no means idle or unimportant: since, if capable of esta-
blishnient, it will, in a considerable degree, remove the objections
which attach 10 1116 common systems of materialism, elucidate the
Mosam account of the first creation of the seul freni a divine brecztlc or
aura infused into the body, and give stability to universal tradition,
by developing the nature of that evanescent and shadowy texture, un-
der which, among all nations, th‘exsoul has ever been supposed to exist.
Opposed as the two theories of a, ἶ11115111 (111 the manner in which itis

as positively predicted 111 1116 Christian seriptures. The immate-

ideas, is under the necessity of supposing the existence of another and
a very different substance in a state of coinbination with it: a suh-
