Obciderunt‚ magnis quei gentibus inperitarunt.

Ille quoque ipse, viam qui quondam per mare magnum

Stravit, iterque dedit legionibus ire per altum,

Ac pedibus salsas docuit superare lacunas,

Et contempsit equis, insultans, murmura ponti 3

Lumine adempto, animam moribundo corpore fudit.

Scipiades, belli fulmen, Carthaginis horror,

Ossa dedit terroe, proinde ac famul infimus esset.

“ Adde repertores doctrinarum, atque leporum:

Adde Heliconiadum comites3 quorum unus Homerus,

The poet alludes to Xerxes king of Persia, of whom
Herodotus nai-rates that he walked over the sea,

“ and sailed on dry land : alluding to his having thrown

an immense bridge over the Hellespont, and dug a
channel nearly around the whole of mount Athos,
through which a considerable portion of his fleet
passed. There is an idle tale related of him by the
same historiari, that, upon the destruction of his
bridge, by a violent tempest‚ he ordered three hun-
dred lashes to be inflicted on the waves, and that
they should be instantly bound with chains. The
courtiers of Xerxes, it should seem, had flattered
him to more purpose respecting his power over this
clement, than those of Canute were able to accom-
plish in‘later times. Milton has alluded to this anec-
dote of Xerxes, in his Par. Lost‚ ix. 306.

So, if great things to small may be compar’d,

Os1·ar1sack'dTYRE‚—-] The poet refers to

1050

Publius Cornelius Scipio, who obtained the honour-
able surname of Africanus from his triumphs over
Hannibal. So capricious, however, at all times, was
the favour of the Roman people, that this consum-
mate warrior, as well as virtuous man, at length fell
into discredit, and was accused by the tribunes of
having been bribed by Antiochus 10 consent to a
peace. Scipio thought it unworthy of himself to be
in the city during his trial, οι· personally to stand sor-
wards in his own defence: he retimd, therefore, to
Liternum in Campania, where he died about the year
of Rome 567. The phrase ‘⁶ thunder-bolt of war,'’
bellisulmen, has been copied by virgil, and applied
both to himself and his relation of the same name,
who afterwards rivalled him so effectually in martial
glory and success z

geminos, duo fulmina belli,

See, both the Scipios, tlumder-bolts os war,
The double bane of Afric.

Cicero has caught the same metaphor, and has in-
troduced it into his oration for Cornelius Balbus: cum

duosulmina nostri imperii Cnaeiun et Publius Scipiones

 

Scipiadas, cladem Libyae.
