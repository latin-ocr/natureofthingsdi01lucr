THE NATURE OF THINGS.

Or dire disease‚ we see, or think we see,

Though the dank grave have long their bones inhum'd.

Yet not unknown to me how hard the task

Such deep obscurities of GREECE t' unfold

In LATIN numbers3 to combine new terms,

And strive with all our poverty of tongue—

But such thy virtue, and the friendship pure

My bosom bears, that arduous task I dare;

And yield the sleepless night,

had been wicked, or a coward, it was suffered to
hover for ever on the wretched banks of the Loda,
or was condemned to wander on all the winds of
heaven, often perversely misleading the way-worn and
benighted traveller, in the shape of an {gnis—fatuus.

Respecting the ghosts of the Celtic superstition,
there was one remarkable fact, which I cannot avoid
noticing in this place. While other religions have
often conceived such a kind of etherial spirit as se-
parately existing‚ immediately after the decease of
the body,—the system of Fingal assumed, that the
hero had a separate shade or spirit attending him some
short time prior to his death, counterfeiting his
figure, and appearing to different persons, with the
most mournful shrieks, and in the attitude in which
he was about to die. ‘⁶ The account given to this
“ day, among the vulgar,'' observes Mr. Maepher—
son, ‘⁴ of this extraordinary matter, is very poetical.
“ The ghost comes mounted on a meteor, and sur-
“ rounds twice or thrice the place destined for the
“ person to die in; and then goes along the road
‘⁶ through which the funeral is to pass, shrieking at
“ intervals: at last, the meteor and the ghost dis-
“ appear above the burial place.’'

Ver. 158. —that arduous task I dare ,·

And yield the sleepless night,——] There is a
passage in the Abbt‘: Delille's very beautiful, and,
in the French language, unrivalled didactic poem of

in hope to cull

Les Jardins, in the composition of which the poet
seems to have had his eye directed to this elegant ad-
dress of Lucretius. He exhorts his horticultural
pupils not to rest satisfied, in their attempts to form
a fountain, if, at first, and even for a long time af-
terwards, they should be disappointed in the flow of
water: he advises them to dig deeper and deeper,
since probably the earnestly-desired fluid is just at
hand. And he then proceeds :

Ainsi d'un long effort moi-meme rebut6‚
Qandj'ai d'un froid detail maudit Pandite,
Soudain un trait heureux jaillit d'un fond sterile,
Et mon vers ranime coule enfin plus facile.

So when, myself, o'erwearied with the past,
Curse some dry subject still before me cast3

I too, at times, some happy turn explore,
And my rous'd verse flows brisker than before.

But the style and imagery of Mason, in his English
Garden, exhibits a copy of Lucretius far closer still;
and especially in the following passage :

 

lngrateful sure,

When such the theme, becomes the poet’s rask:
Yet must he try, by modulation meet

Of varied cadence, and selected phrase,

Exact yet free, without inflation bold,

To dignify that theme ; must try to form

Such magic sympathy cf sense with sonml,

As pictures all it sings : while Graes awakes
