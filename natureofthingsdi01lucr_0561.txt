life and spirit to the whole atmosphere; for, when
once abstracted‚ atmospheric air becomes totally un-
fit for the purposes ofrespiration, vegetation, or com-
bustion. It occupies about a fourth part of the com-
mon air of the atmosphere : the remainder of which,
as incapable of supporting the phaenomena of animal
life, is denominated mephytis‚ or azotic gass: and
which,as filling nearly three quartersofthe atmosphere,
may be well entitled to the appellation of air alone.
Respiration‚ then, is an action contributing to the
renovation of life by the communication of atmo-
spheric air to the praecordia3 the air so communi-
cated, in a manner, to the present moment undeter-
rnined, becoming hereby decomposed or separated
into four, or perhaps a greater number of simpler
gasses, of which each contributes, in a greater or
less degree, to the preservation of life and sensation ;
and especially the caloric, which seems to afford that
continual supply of heat that is absolutely necessary,
from the freedom with which every individual mem-
ber parts with its heat to circumjacent and external
substance33 and more especially still, the oxygen,
which, by Spallanzani and Girtanner, is supposed
to stimulate the beart itself into action, and to be
the immediate cause of all muscular irritability‚ and
consequently of vitality itself. A small portion,
however, of this important gass, we detect'rcturning
from the lungs in the act of expiration, combined
with a substance generated in the blood ; and which,
from its resemblance to various properties of charcoal,

the French chemists have named carb0n3 the mnf.
produced from this union, and discharged in erpi.
ration, is denominated carbonic aeid gass.

I pretend not to affirm what was the iniustum„
aura understood by Lucretius as the fourth and ines(
important substance in the composition of the :inim ll
spirit 3 and which, he tells ns, was so recondite as to b:
incapable of being traced otherwise than by its effecte
To the oxygenous and the galvanio gass it has an equai
and an astonishingly striking resemblance. [τ’ we
suppose our poet intended something like the former.
although he has not given it its modern name, hc
has described the very thing itse1f‚ endowcd it with
its characteristic properties, asserted its entire supi-e-
macy, and established it in its immediate seat ok*
empire, the heart and lungs. He has given us, in-
deed, whether we allow this to be a fact or not, as
complete a statement of the gasses of which the ani-
mal breath or spirit consists, as if he had lived in the
present day. And what is more extraordinary still,
though he enumerates the three substances' of beat,
air, and vapour, as fluids rejected in the act of ex-
piration‚ he makes no mention of the return of this
fourth, and, in his era, unnamed substance; while,
nevertheless, as already obaerved, he deems it the
most powerful agent in the composite spirit inhaled‚
The follow-
ing table of the Epicurean and Lavoisierian analysis
of respirable air, will still more clearly point out the
resemblance between them z

and the sensorial faculty engendered.
