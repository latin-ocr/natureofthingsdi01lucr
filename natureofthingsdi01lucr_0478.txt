DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. 11.

Humoris guttas mater quom Terra recepit,

Feta parit nitidas fruges, arbustaque laeta,

Et genus humanum3 parit omnia secla ferarum ;

Pabula quom praebet, quibus omnes corpora pascunt,

295

Et dulcem ducunt vitam, prolemque propagant:

Quapropter merito maternum nomen adepta est.

Cedit item retro, de terra quod fuit ante,

In terra53 et, quod missum est ex aetheris oris,

to which all must return; and which alone can ir-
radiate our intellects.” Sir William Jones, vol. iii.
62. So, in the Upanishad, translated into Persian
by the order of the emperor Dara Shecuh, we are told,
that ‘⁴ τΗε UMVERSAL souL filleth all time ; is
present in every place z he is the sight of sights‚ the
hearing of hearings, the thought of thoughts, the
science of sciences; and hence, can neither be seen,
cqmprehended, or learned ε he is the root and principle
of all things.’' See the Latin version of this book by
Anquetil du Perron‚ tom. Ι. Paris, 1802. As also
note on ver. 665, of the present book.

In the earlier part of his life, Virgil was, undoubt-
edly, an Epicurean ; and his sixth eclogne, in which
the principles of this philosophy are briefly developed,
is supposed, by the critics, to be nothing more than
the substance of a lecture delivered to himselfand his
friend Varro, by Syro, their common tutor, of whom
Cicero makes mention ir. his Epist. Famil. l. vi. 1 υ
under the fictitious names of Silenus, Chromis, and
Mnasilm. There is nothing extraordinary, there-
fore, that the writings of Virgil at this time should
be consentaneous with those of Lucretius : but Vir-
gil appears·aftcrwards to have been converted to the
system, either of Plato or Pythagoras, philosophers
who, iu thc main, seem not to have differed very es-
sentially from each other. When, therefore, at this
period of his life, he meets with another opportunity
of developing the origin of the universe, as he does in
book VI. of his AEneid, and in the person of Anchi-

ses, he publishes the doctrine he had lately embraced,
and discards those parts of his former tenets which
are inimical to it. But the passage of Lucretius
now before υε, as well as that which is a continuation
of the same theory, beginning at Book I. v. 287,
will as readily accord with the opening of Virgil’s new
creed, as of his old. The commencement of this new
creed, however, is beautiful, and I shall copy it ε

Principio coelum, ac terras, camposque liquentes,

Lucentemque globum lunae, Titaniaque astra

Spiritus intus alit, totamque infusa per artus

Mens agitat molem, et magno se corpore miscet.

Inde hominum pecudumque genus, vitaeque vo-
lantum,

Et quae marmoreo fert monstra sub aequore pontus.

Igneus est ollis vigor, et celestis origo

Seminibus. AEumn, 1. vi. v. 7²4·

Know, first, that heaven and earth’s compacted
frame,

And flowing waters, and the starry frame,

And both the radiant lights‚ one common soul

Inspires and feeds, and animates the whole.

This active mind, infus’d through all the space,

Unites, and mingles with the mighty mass.

Hence, men and beasts the breath of life obtain ς

And birds of air, and monsters of the main.

Th’ etherial viguur is in all the same,

And every soul is fill’d with equal flame.
Wnrou.
