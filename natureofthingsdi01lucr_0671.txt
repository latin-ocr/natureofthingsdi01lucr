THE NATURE OF THINGS.

To fill for ever the still leaking urn.

every species: hence the Saxon, r⁵⁷l³³ the Ger-
man, schiff3 the Dutch, schippen3 and our own
English term ship, differing from the Egyptian alone
by the prefu: of a single letter. Hence too, at the
present day, the Coptics apply the same word alu
to the Ibis, which is an aquatic fowl of the crane
kind: and hence, probably, the Ethiopic gn:
(Hybo) ‘¹ copious dew;”—water‚ the immediate
clement of the Hyp, Ship, or Ibis.

The next term, of which the name Hypermnestra,
Hyp-Ur-M’ns-T'r-A, is compounded, is Ur. But
Ur or Or, upon the theory now referred to,
is the Sun, or God of fire ;-—it forms the radicat of
the Egyptian Orus, and constitutes a part of the
Greek 11011115, Hercules and Phrygia. The proposed
etymology of the word Menes, I have already re-
marked upon in the note above referred to, Book II.
v. 1167 ; and observed that, from various traditions
and authors, it is conceived to be only an additional
name for Noah, or whatever other deity was worshipcd
as the First Parent of all things3 whence, obvi-
ously, Manes, Minos. Meon, Menu, Moon, Μην,
Μ311Ξὲ113, (the same as Mm aud Moon‚) in the
Friendly Isles of the Pacifie Ocean, which, both
from language and religious rites, are plausibly sup-
posed, by modern authors, to have been peopled
from the descendants of Chus.

The term Tar, implies dark, deep, or mysterious.
Hence Tamarus, which is only a reduplication of the
same word, so as to bestow on it a superlative significa-
tion, and imply something extremely dark, extremely
deep,ormysterious: and hence again ταρσυς( tarsus)“the
soot,’' being the deepest, or lowest part of the body.
Thusfl also, the Hebrew fflU‘Jn (“ Targumss’)
“ interpretation,'’ rendered conversely, and of course
the opposite to mystery. The word a with which
this compound terminates, is of similar import with
Αἰ in the foregoing Ai- C'-Es-Theus (AEgystheus)
and refers to place, or situation.

The punishment to which these faithless damsels
were doomed‚ is supposed to prove that the entire
sable, is of Arkite aud Egyptian origin. In

commemoration of the deliverance of the great father
of the human racc from the flood, (whether under the
name of Thoth, Danaus, Menes, or Osiris, which last
was another appellation bestowed upon him‚) the
Egyptians are known to have instituted a peculiar re-
ligious rite, which consisted in the procession ofa
consecrated ark or vesseL carried in triumph through
the streets, as a token of the safe debat-kation of the
patriarch² Upon this ceremony, Plutarch expressly
informs us, de Isid. et Osyrid. that, ‘⁶ on the nine-
teenth of the month Choiac (corresponding with the
sixteenth of our December), they descend into the
sea, and the keepers of the robes, together with the
priests, take out the consecrated chest‚ which con-
tains within itself a little ark quold, χρυσουν Κιέωτω».
into which they pour clean water, and proclaim by 3
shout, from all the multitude present, that Osiris is
safe.’' The filling the ark with water was designed,
most probably, to designate that it was sound, and
free from leaking ε and the punishment fabulously
bestowed upon these unfaithful priestesses, to typify,
in the first place, the breaches they had committed
upon it, and, secondly, to bestow upon them a reward
due to their infidelity. It is obvious, from this
sketch‚ that most of the preceding fables are, in like
manner, referable to a Babyloniam or Egyptian origin.
But it would protract the present commentary to an
insufferable length, and be wandering too far from its
main design, to pursue this subject any further.
