Ver. 104.

‘The mental sense no part specfic frames,

But springs the vital product qf Ibe whole] To
this doctrine I have adverted iu note on v. ioo. lt
is said to have been first invented by Aristoxenus, a
pupil‚ at first, of Lamptus of Erythraea, afterwardz
of Xenophylus the Pythagorean, and lastly of Aris-
totle. He was most excelleutly skilled in music,
though by profession a physician3 and to this ad-
diction to music, we probably owe the name of
Harmwy, by which he designated this peculiar doc-
trine. This derivation of the termis countcnanced
by our poet himself in v. 140; and its meaning is
thus more fully explained by Lactantius: sicut in
fidibus, ex intentione nervorum efficitur concors so-
nus atque cantus, quem musici harmoniam vocant;
ita in corporibus ex compage viscerum et vigore
membrorum vis sentiendi existit. “ As, in musical
instruments, an accord and consent of sounds, which
musicians term Harmony, is produced by the due
tone of the string53 so in bodies, the faculty
of perception proceeds from the due connexion
and vigour of the members and organs of the body.'’
This opinion Lucretius strenuously denies, by ob-
serving, that the mind may be diseased, while the
body entirely escapes; and that the body, on the
contrary, may lose some of its own organs or mem-
bers, and yet the mind, and even the general health
of the body itself‚ continue perfect.

Pelignac, who, consistently with the Cartesian
system, makes a distinction between the mind or souL
and the life, observes, that the term Harniony, as ex-
plained by the disciples ofAristoxenus, may accurately
enough apply to the latren though he also eontends,
that it is incompetent to express the powers= of the
former ε

Sunt quibus haud aliud nostrae mens incola molis
Visa fuit, nisi membrorum concentus, et ipsa
Corporis harmonie, fibris concordibus apte.

Sed modus est haec hannonie, quae vita profecto
Jure potest, at non hominis mens ipsa vocari.
Auri-Luca. v. 923.

This doctrine appears to have sustaincd a kind of
resuscitandum among some modern philosophcrs, and
especially in the Treatise Du Droit Naturel, Civil, et
Politique of M. Luzac, who not only regards the
frame of man, and otlzer anmals, but the frame of
the universe at large, as a sort of musical organ or
instrument, the concordant and accumulated action
of whose different parts or agents, like Aristoxenus,
he denominates Harmony. ‘⁶ Concerts of music,”
says he, “ afford a clear example : you perceive har-
mony in music, when different tones, obtained by
the touch of various instruments, excite one general
sound, a compound of the whole.'' This observa-
tion he applies to the operations of nature at large,
the irregularities of which, resulting from inundations,
earthquakes, volcanos, tempestS, and similar evils,
M. Luzac considers as the dissonances occasioually
introduced into music to heighten the harmony of the
entire system. With respect to the harmony of the
human frame, individually contemplated, or the con-
cordant aetion of different parts of the body, he ob-
serves, ‘⁶ it may be said, that ofthis principle I have
merely a confused noti0n3 and I admit it, if the as-
sertion imply, that I have neither a perfect, nor a
distinct, nor an entire comprehension of what pio-
duces this harmony, in what it consistS, how it acts.
-Ι know not what produces the harmony of various
musical instruments heard simultaneously ; bnt Ι cau
accur-ately distinguish the sounds which are occa-
sioned when musicians are tuning‚ from those which
are produced when, being completely iu tune, and
every one uniting in the piece, the separate parts ar<
executed with exactitudae. then Ι h'ear an har--
monions mund, whatever be its nature, I can di»
tinguish the harmony‚ though incapable of invem>
gatiug its cause.'' Tom. i. 154.
