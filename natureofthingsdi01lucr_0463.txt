THE NATURE OF THINGS.

The race of worms, when once the mingl'mg show'r

Wakes the warm ferment through the putrid mass,

the two sexes perfect in the same subject. But the
earth-worm, dew-worm, snails, cels, oysters, and
many other species of shell fishes, are complete her·
maphrodites 3 and the number of animals of this class
is so considerable, that M. Poupart believes it to ex-
ceed that of those which are divided into sexes. See
Mem. de l’Acad. des Sciences. While these propa-
gate their kinds from their own single exertions, there
are other shell-fishes, as we learn from Mr. Adansom
in his account ofSenegal, that require the union of not
less than three individuals for the same genial pur—
pose. In like manner it has lately been proved by M.
Girtanner‚ that the conferva fontinalis, first noticed by
Dr. Priestlcy, requires heat, light, and water, though
nothing else, for the production of this vegetable.
The hennaphrodite power of many of the anim-als
here enumerated‚ has been long known to the world.
Itis mentioned by Homer and Athenaeus, but more
particularly in the following verses of Oppian:

Au’ eux tyxfflittovw ὀμοιιον, ou& χελοιοιις

οντ’ ουν πουλυποὲεσσι 'yoniam τελος, ουτε κελαινῇ

Αιιευτ i. 5¹3-

Not thus conchs, cels, and polypi embrace,
Nor purple lampreys rear their embryo race-
In selfish coiis, hermaphrodite‚ they sit,
And their own powers the vital spume emit,
Which gradual dropp’d on sands or slimy mud
A silvei· offering render to the flood. γ

Spalanzani detected many vegetable seeds, ex-
tremely diminutive in their form, the vitality of which
it is almost impossible to destroy either by heat or
chemical solvents. In like manner, he discovered the
eggs of many animalcules confined in vegetable seeds,
still possessing a power of producing their definite
orders of meets, after such seeds had been exposed
to the most intense heat of buming coals, and even
the blow-pipe itself3 and. although reduced into the
most subtle powder, aster having hereby been con—

verted into calces. Thus, too, many animals and
vegetables have an equally wonderful power of
resuscitation after apparent destruction: among the
latter may be mentioned the nostoc and tremella,
which perpetually spring up after they have seemed
to perishz and among the former the chaos redi-
vivum, the vorticella or wheel-animal, the sloth, and
the tile-cel, a new species discovered by Spalanzani
in the impalpablc dust of bricks and tiles. In the
case of this last insect‚ the alternate process of death
and resurrection was carried on with success, and
with the same animalcule, for not less than eleveu
times, by keeping it dry and without saud, and af-
terwards moistening it with water. Eggs and seeds,
after a torpor of months or even years, are otca-
sionally revived on being moistened with warin waterg
and in like manner, some shell-snails in the cabinets of
the curious have revived on the same applicati0n‚ after
having been kept in a dry state for ten or twelve
years.

It was in consequence of such experiments‚ that
the Count de Buffon established a system which ap-
pears strongly inclined to resuscitate the doctrine of
equivocal generation contended for by Lucretius.
According to this celebrated naturalist, all matter
swarms with organic germs or molecules, which serve
for the nutriment of organized bodies, till they
acquire a state of maturity‚ and augmentation ceases ;
and for their seminal stores afterwards. But inde-
pendently of seminal secretion, he contends that
when large quantities of these prolific germs are col-
lected in any part of an animal body, wherever such
germs are compelled to remain together,- they create
certain orders of living beings, which-have always
been regarded as real animals. The taenia, the asca-
rides, all the worms found in the veins, in the liver,
in wounds, in pussand most of those discovered in
putrid flesh, have, according to this system, no other
origin. The eels in paste and vinegar‚ the tadpoles
in the male semen, and all the pretended microscopic
animals‚ are only different forms assumed, according
