Rears the young spring, the fiery summer rears‚

Loaded with fruits, and autumn's vine-clad

The bright horizon he for ever gilds,

Os doubgful phrase, mysterious3—] That Hera-
clitus, in common with some other philosophers‚ con-
ceived all things to have originated from fire, we learn
from the following assertionof Plutarch. Plac. Phil. i. 3.

Metapontus, maintained that the principle of all
things was fire ι that from fire every thing proceeded,
and to it would finally return.'' And that his writ-
ings were obscure and difficult to be understood, as
likewise that he purposely aimed at such abstruse-
ness of style, we are informed by Cicero, de Fin.
lib. 2. De industria, says he, et consulto, occulte
dixit. On this account he was generally denominat·
ed σκοτεινος, obscure. And Menage informs us, that
he affected this obscurity of diction in imitation of
nature herself 3 ad Laert. vit. Heracl. φυσις γαρ μετ’

The fond, sequacious herd, to mystic faith,

And blind amazement prone. Summa.

Hence the proprietyof the advice gIven by Vida,

Verborum inprimis tenebros fuge, nubilaque atra 3

Nam neque (si tantum fas credere) defuit olim,

Qui lumen jucundum ultro, lucemque perosus,

Obscuro nebulae se circumfudit amictu:

Tantus amor noctis, latebrae tam dira cupido.

In chief, avoid obscurity, nor shroud

Your thoughts and dark conceptions in a cloud ς

For some we know affect to lose the light

Lost in forc'd figures, and involv'd in night ;

Studious and bent to shun the common way,

Theyskulkindarkness‚and abhor the day. Ριττ.
