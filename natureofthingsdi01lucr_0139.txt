tween the atomio philosophy and scepticism 3 and Lci'nnitz *i- and Wolse
between that and Platonism or Pythagorism. lIobhcs‚ the intimate
friend of Gassendi, attempting to press the atomic system still further,
was reviving the long explodcd doctrine of Democritus 1‘csp‹·cti11g tho
necessary intelligcnce of separate elementary corpusclcs ; aud Spumea,
with several other heterodox Jews of Spain and P‹›rtugal‡‚ were rencw-
ing the old Eleatie doctrine that the universe, or matter collectively,
and not in distinet atoms, was the Deity‚ and. efficient cause of all
things. It is not a little singular, that this last doctrine of Spinosa, or
rather of Xenophanes, from whom both himselfand the Eleatie sect
immediately derived it, that God is the Universm and the Uim-erse
God, not transitivcly‚ οι· with a power of emanation, but iinmiuently
and immutably, was now, for the first time, pretendcd to be discovered
as comprising a part of the saith professed by. two philosophie frater-

nonce qu’il n'y a plus que des ignorans on des entetes qui puissent juger mal d'Epicnre. Discours Pre-
lim. de M. de Bougainville. See his translation of Polignac's Anti-Lucretius into French.

† The monads of Leibnitz, however, are not precisely the same as those of Epicurus. They were im-
mediately derived from the Pythagoric system, and hence have a closer resemblance to the numbers of the
Samiam or the ideas of the Academic philosophy. Monads, under Leibnitz‚ as under Pythagoras, have
no parts, neither extension, figure, nor divisibility3 each, however, is'⁴ a truc atom of nature, and incapa-
ble of destruction, except by the power of the Creator. Each monad differs from every other3 and each
is also possessed of perception and appetite, in which respect each may be said to partake of the nature of
sonl. This power of perception and appetite produces an internal principle of alteration; and hence the.
sympathies and affinities‚ the repulsions and septimium, the combinations and forms of bodies. It is to this
source, therefore, that we are obviously to look for the foundation of the late Dr. Darwin's philosophy,
though I do not remember that he has any where* indicated the. fountain from which he derived it.

‡ A complete edition of the works of Spinosa have been lately pu-blished in SVO. by professor Paulus of
Jena. Spinosa was the son> of a Portuguese JeW‚ and born at Amsterdam in 1632. His mode of
reasoning is extremely incorrect 3 and hence his arguments may, in many instances, be as well adapted by
his adversaries as by himself. The following extract may serve as an example of this want of appropria.
tion. Propositio. “ Idci rei singulam, actu existentis, Deum pro causa habet; non quatenus infinitus
est, sed quatenus alia rei singularis actu existemis idea affectus consideratur ; cujus etiam Deus est causa,
quatenus alia tertii affectus est, et sic in infinitum.”

Demonstratio. “ Idea rei singularis, actu existentis, modussingularis cogitandi est, et a reliquis dis.
tinctus; adeoque Deum, quatenus est tantum res cogitans, pro causa habet. At non, quatenus est res
absolute cogitans; sed quatenus alio cogitandi modo affectus consideratur, et hujus etiam, quatenus alio
affectus est, et sic in infinitum. At qui ordo, et connexio idearum idern est ac ord0, et connexio cansarum3
ergo unius singularis ideae alia idea sive Deus, quatenus alia idea affectus consideratur, est causa, et hujus*
etiam, quatenus alia affectus est, etsie in infinitum.’' QE. D. Ethic. Prop. ix. ⁷
