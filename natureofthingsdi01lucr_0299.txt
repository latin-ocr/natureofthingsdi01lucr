Boox Ι. ΤΗΕ NATURE OF THINGs 151

Sweet the new flowers that bloom: but sweeter still 990
Those flow'rs to pluck, and weave a roseat wreaffi,
The muses yet to mortals ne'er have deign’d.

With joy the subject I pursue3 and free

The captiv’d mind from superstition’s yoke.

&Vith joy th’ obscure illume3 in liquid verse, 99 5¹
Graeeful, and clear, depicting all survey’d z

By reason guided. For as oft, benign,

The sapient nurse, when anxious to enforce

on almost every occasion, the rose. Thus, Od. xv,
edit. Barnes:

In like manner, the sentimental Sadi, in his Gu-
listan:

assub> ἐμω· wis 1³ Q as
&mil-s) OM 25)th ὦ

’Tis not the nightingale alone
That, seated mid the rose's sweets,
Talks of her charms in tenderest tone ;
For every thorn the theme repeats.

Ου μοι μελει Γυγαο
Του Σαρδεων avam-oc
Εμοι μελει ροδοισι

Καταστεφειν καρῆναι

I care not for the idle state
Of Persia’s king, the rich, the great!
But oh l be mine the rosy braid,
The fervour of my brows to shade.
Μοοκε.

 

The custom was probably of Asiatic origin, yet
the Persian 'poets seem to have been sonder of strew-
ing roses around them, than of entwining them in
their hair3 at least, the latter fashion is by no means
so frequently referred to as the former. Thus,
Hafiz, in one of his most beautiful gazels :

exve·- ΛΦ 0¹³) 5²⁵2&ss ζέων(

&fotam »ὴλῖὣῦἆ υἱώ w?-

Come, jovial, to the garden lead,

Let noise, and mirth‚ and madness vie ;
Like nightingales‚ from anguish freed,

ln nests ⁴osroser let us lie.

Ver. 998. For as ost, benign,

The sapient nurse, when anxious to ergfhrce] This
simile, as well as many others which will appear as
we proceed, has been closely copied by Tasso in his
Jerusalem Delivered. 1 cannot, however, agree with
his commentator Nardius‚ that the copy is superior
to the original: “ dum aemulatur,'’ says he of Tor-
quato, ‘⁴ palmam auctori eripuit.’' Let the reader

compare them ι

Sai che la corre il mondo ove piu versi
Di sue dolcezze il lusinghier Parnasso3
E che il vero condito in molli versi,

Ι piu schivi allettando ha persuaso.
Cos} all’ egro fanciul porgiamo aspersi
Di soave licor gli orli del vasoz

Succhi amri ingannato intanto ei beve,

E dall’ inganno sua vita riceve. Cant. i„
