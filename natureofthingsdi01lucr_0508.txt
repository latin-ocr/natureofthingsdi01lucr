DE RERUM NATURA.

arinen from the earth ; but this was by no means so
general a belief as the two preceding, and was or·
dinarily confined to the Titans and giants‚ or to such
deified heroes as, like Erechtheus, were immediately
connected with the rites of Ceres, and the cultivation
ofcorn. See on the former subject, note on Book I.
767 ς and on the latter. note on Book VI. v- Ι.

Ι have asserted, that these three systems of ido-
latry, though in themselves distinct and separate, yet
were perpetually blending and amalgamating : and l
shall subjoin‚ as an additional proof of such asser-
tion, that all the three types whence these idolatries
originated, were equally admitted as emblema, though
as nothing more, into the religion of the Jews. On
the reverence which was paid by this people to the
clement of fire, I have already animadverted in the
note on Book Ι. ν. 693. It was in the character of
a flaming pyramid or burning bush, that Jehovah
appeared to Moses on mount Horeb, and to the
Hebrews at large on the promulgation of the law
from mount Sinai. The formation of a memorial
ark was expressly commanded by God himself, on
the establishment of the written law, and an express
canon of ceremonies ordained on the occasion.
And when this rebellious people were deservedly
plagued, in their journey through the desert, with
disease and mortality‚ from the bite of multitudes of
venomous serpents sent among thern for this purpose,
the Almighty commanded them to erect a fiery
serpent, upon a lofty pole or pillar‚ as an emblem of
his providence and heahng power, by looking towards
which all who were diseased imrnediatelybecame sound.
Other literary observations, in connection with the same
theory, the reader may find iu the notes on Book I.

Athenians, thus represents Erectheus, the founder of
this celebrated republic, as the immediate progeny of
the earth, although suckled by Minerva 3

’ Athens the fair, where great Erectheus sway'd‚

That ow’d his nurture to the blue-ey’d maid ς
But from the teeming furrow took his birth,
The mighty offspring of the sruitful Earth.

ovid, in the commencement of his Metamorpho-
sis, appears to be doubtful whether, in the formation
of man, he should incline to the system of Plato, or
of Epicurus, and, in consequence, writes thus:

Natus homo est ε sive hunc divino semine fecit
Ille opifex rerum, mundi melioris origo,

Sive recens tellus, seductaque nuper ab alto
AEthere.

Then man was made, whose animated frame
Or God inform'd with a celestial flame,
Or Earth srom purer heav’n but lately freed.

Ver. 1 1 73. Then, roo, spontaneous, from the soil she
rear’d
Thosc luscious sruits, those vines, &c.—] To
the same effect, Ovid :

Ver erat aeternum, placidique tepentibus auris

Mulcebant zephyri natos sine semine flores.

Mox etium fruges tellus inarata ferebat,

Nec renovatus ager gravidis canebat aristis.
ΜετΑΜ. Book Ι. v. 101.

The teeming earth, yet guiltless of the plough,

And unprovok’d‚ did fruitful stores allow.

The flowers unseen, in fields and meadows reign'd,

And western winds immortal spring maintain’d.

In following years the bcarded corn ensu’d

From earth unask’d, nor was that earth renew'd.
Davom.
