THE NATURE OF THINGS.

Thus, too, the head,

VVhene'er dissever'd from the vital trunk,

Still keeps its look of life, with open eye

Still stares, till all the gradual soul expire.

So should thy blade some serpent's length of tail
Divide‚ quick-brandishing its furious tongue‚

The sever'd parts writhe‚ agoniz'd‚ and broad

Scatter the purple fluid; while himself

Looks round revengeful, and, from pain severe,

Gnashes the segments of his mangled frame.

shall we then say that each divided part

A perfect soul contains ? then with such souls

The total form, ere injur'd‚ must have throng'd.

Hence severs, then, the soul, though close combin'd,

When ah ! a shark bit through bis waist,
His heart’s blood dy'd the shore.

He shriek’d !—his half sprung from the main,
Streaming with purple gore.

Ver. 666. So should thy blade some serpent’s length
of tail

Divide‚ quick·brandishing its furious tangue,
The sever'd parts writhe, agoniz’d,—-] Our
poet’s description of the wounded snake, as of every
other natural fact, is accurate and unimpeacliable,
for he at all times draws from Nature herself. The
pertinacious adherence of life to many animals, is
truly wonderful. I have already observed, that in
worms, polypi, and several other reptiles of the
same simplicity of fmme, a division of the body, in-
stead of destroying life, augments it, as every section

becomes a distinct and perfect animal. Lobstem
crabs, spiders, and various others, again, although
not capable of propagating life by sections, have an
astonishing power of reproducing their mangled or
amputated members. 1 have noticed, in a former
place, that the land-tortoise will live six months after
being deprived of its braim and Redi informs us,
that in several instances he has known it survive for
three or four and twenty days after the separation of
its head from its body. The pertinacity to life in
the snake is not equal to this, but it approximates it
by the length of time every segment will retain, not.
merely irritability, but animation. There is a kind
of fury and vivacity which natumlists have noticed in
every fragment of this reptile, that is scarcely pa-
ralleled by any other animal. Its heart will continue
to beat for thirty hours after its death.
