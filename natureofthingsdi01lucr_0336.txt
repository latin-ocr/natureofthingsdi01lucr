DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. 11.

Si non aurea sunt juvenum simulacra per aedeis,

Lampadas igniferas manibus retinentia dextris,

25

Lumina nocturnis epulis ut subpeditentur,

Nec domus argento fulget, auroque renidet,

Nec citharae reboant laqueata aurataque templa3

Quom tamen inter se, prostratei in gramine molli,

Propter aquae rivum, sub ramis arboris altae,

30

Non magnis opibus jocunde corpora curant z

Praesertim, quom tempestas adridet, et anni

Tempora conspargunt viridanteis floribus herbas :

Nec calidae citius decedunt corpore febres,

Textilibus si in picturis, ostroque rubenti,

From the arched roof
Pendeat by subtle magio, many a row

Of starry lamps, and blazing cressets, fed

With naphtha, and asphaltus, yielded light
As from a sky.

Ver. 29. Yet listless laid the velvet grass along]
Hence, perhaps, Mr. Gray, in a passage admirably
picturesque, and exquisite :

Where‘er the oak's thick branches stretch
A broader, browner sliade,

VVhere'er the rude and mess-grown beech
O'ercanopies the glad-3,

neside some water's rushy brinkr

With me the muse shall sit and think

At ease reclin’d. >

ln abeautiful Asiatic poem, entitled Moha Mud-
gam, or, A Remedy for Distraction of Mind, tran-
slated by Sir william Jones, we have a passage so
consentaneous with the present, that I cannot avoid
transcribing it. Here, however, the writer is adevo-
tce, as well as a poet: ‘⁶ To dwell under the man-
sion of the high gods, at the foot of a tree3 to have

35

the ground for a couch‚ and a hide for vesture; to
renounce all extrinsic enjoyments, whom doth not
such ssdevotion fill with delight ?’' Jones's Works‚
1. 212.

Ver. 34. On down reclin’d, or wrapp'd in purple robe

The thirsty sever buras with beat as fiet-ce, δία]

Towards this passage, we obser-ve Horace turning
his eye, in the first book of his Epistles :

Non domus et fundus, non aeris acervus et auri
AEgroto domini deduxit corporefcbres
Non animo curas. Epist. ii.
Nor splendid house, nor spacious land,

Nor wealth with wealth combin’d,
Can fevers from the flesh command,

Or troubles from the mind.

As he does also to the passage beginning at ver. 48,

relating to cares and terrors. We meet with it
the second book of his odes :

Non enim gazae, neque consularis

Summovet lictor miseros tumultus ⁷

Mentis, et cuiuis laqueata circum
Tecta volantos
