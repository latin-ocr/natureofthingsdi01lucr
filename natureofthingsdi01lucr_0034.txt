xx THE LIFE OF LUCRETIUS.

while they asthrd him abundant iuaterials sor his narrative. From the
reeords that yet romain, however, and the most plausible conjectures
of his editors and annotator-s, I ani enabled to ‘present the reador
with the following pagos.

Titus Lueretius Carus was ,horn at Rome, iu the second year of
the 17'15tOlympiad ¹5, the &seth of the city, ancl the 90th anterior
to the Christian aera, during the consulate of Licinius Crassus, and

Quintus Mutius Scaevola ; being one year younger than Caesar, and nine
than Cicero, His name imports, that ho was a descendant, and he

is generally admitted to have been so, from one of the most ancient
and illustrious families ofthe eommouwealth ; whose collateral branehes
had suecessively been elected to the highest offices in the. state, and
had often evineed the most distinguished abilities in their respective
characters of consuls, tribunes, and praetors From which of these

ἓ* I have followed the Chroniele of Eusebius, in fixing· the dates both of the birth and death of Lu—
cretius ς for they so well correspond with the few political facts which are incidentally connected with his
life as to carry along with them a strong internal proof of precision and veracity. These dates, however,
have been disputed by a variety os biographic critics ; and, almost every one of them having offered a dif-
ferent ground for his dissent, no man, perhaps, has ever had so many periods faed, either for his na-
tivity or decease. Lambinus assei-ts, that, upon the calculation of Eusebius, he must have been born
under the consulate of Domitius lEuobarbus and Caius Cassius Longinus ; but this would be to fix his
‘iirth in the first, instead of iu thesteoml year of the 17 ist Olympiad, aud of course in the 657th, instead
of the 65 Sth year of the city. Creech, on the contrary, supposes him to have been born a year later, in-
stead of a year sooner thau Eussnius has compnted. Peter Criniti, a Florentine writer, declares that he
was older, and commonly ailomd to he older, than Cicero, Terence, or Varro. De Poet. Lat. l. ii. Des
Contures, in the life of Lucretius, prefixed to his Frcnch version, brings him into t-he world not less than
και-εἶτε vem-s earlier than Cicero ς and, he is countenanced by Giffanius‚ and Parcus, the editor of the Dau-
phin edition. Even Cassendi, whose accuracy is seldom to be impeached, has, upon this point, made a
most extraordinary mistake 3 and, confounding the day of his decease with that of his birth, asserts that,
according to the Chi-ouicle of Eusebia-2, Lueretius died in the lyist Olympiad, at the age of forty-three ὅ
:md then, reasoning from the very error into which he had bren betrayed, proceeds to contend that he must
have been even older than Zeno, the preceptor at Athens, of Cicero, Atticus, Memmius, and our poet
himself. De Vita Epic. ii. 6. It is either from a blind copy, or a similar misapprehension, that our own
countryman, P. Blount, assigns him an equal degree of antiquity, and contends that he was born about
the year of the city 620 ; conscqueufly, not less than twenty—seven years anterior to the undispnted nati.

vity of Cicero.
