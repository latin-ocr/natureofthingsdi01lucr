DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. I.

Conmemorat speciem lacrumas eefun-dere salsas

Coepisse‚ ‘et rerum naturam expandere dictis.

Quapropter, bene quom superis de rebus habenda

Nobis est ratio ; solis lunaeque meatus

Qua fiant ratione, et qua vi quaeque gerantur

In terris; tunc, cum primis, ratione sagaci,

Unde anima atque animi constet natura, videndum:

Et quae reS‚ nobis vigilantibus obvia, menteis

Terrificet‚ morbo adfectiS‚ somnoque sepultis;

Ver. 149. thence spring those shadowy forms, which,

This part of the duty incumbent on the philosopher,
our poet endeavours to perform in book iv, where
the subject is resumed, and discussed in a truly
scientific and masterly manner‚—c0nsistently, Ι mean,
with the system he has adopted. He there ingeni-
ously assigns the cause why the existence of spectreS‚
ghosts‚ and apparitions, has been so generally ac-
credited in all ages, and nearly among all nafions, as
history informs us it has been; and why· the night
has commonly been the season of their supposed ap-
pearance and operation, rather than the day. Thus
the ghost in Hamlet ι

Ι am thy father's spirit,
D00m¹d for a certain term to walk the night,

Andfor the clay corfin’d.

In the superstitions of all the Northern nafions, the
same idea is to be maced, so far as relates to the
time of apparition. Milton, therefore, with much
appropriate beauty, has compared the demon of death
to the night-hag.

 

riding through the air she comes,
Lur’d with the smell of infant-blood, to dance
With Lapland wstches, while the lab'ring moon
Ecltpses at their charms.

The rule, indeed, seems to be common to all
countries‚ as well as to all periods; to the East and
West‚ as well as to the North3 to the sacred writ-
ings, as well as to heathen mythology. It is, hence,
the same season of doubt and terror that the sublime
author of the book of Job has made choice of, for
the appearance of that fearful spectre, which is so
inimitably described in chap. iv. of this unrivalled
drama, and which has been so often adverted to by
men of tante and discernment. Our common transla-
tion does not give all the beauties which are con-
tained in the original3 and the reader will, therefore,
excuse me for offering him a new version, which, at
least, has the merit of accuracy, as, Ι trust, he will
find, on comparing it with the following arrangement
of the Hebrew:
