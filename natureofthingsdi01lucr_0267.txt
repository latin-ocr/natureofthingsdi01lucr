oxygen and hydrogen. And, indeed, at the late
aerostatie institute at Meudon, the balloons were all
filled from hydrogen alone, obtained from the simple
decomposition ofni-ater by means of an easy, and unex-
pensive process, discovered by Μ. Conti, for whom the
truly seientific GuytonMorveau obtained the director-
ship of this establishment. These experiments then
strike out air from the list ofsimple indestructible sub-
stances, as those 1 have just adverted to strike out
earth and lire.

It is much doubted, however, by some philosopher-s,
since water and air are convertible substance3‚ whe-
ther water be not the radix of air, instead of air be-
ing that of water. VVater, in its natural state, dis—
covers but a small degree of clasticity 3 but when ra-
refied into vapour in an eolipile‚ it will exhibit all the
characters of genuine air, and stream out like a blast
of rapid wind. Yet air, if not a composition of wa—
ter, is, as already observed, a compound of various
gasses, of which, it is probable‚ that every gas is a
compound in itself.

Boerhaave regarded cold as an clement, believing
it to possess an existence sui generis; Linneus oil;
the Chinese philosophers, and Indian bramins‚ the
- ether, or materia subtilis, which the Cartesians sup-
pose to exist throughout the immensity of space, or, at
least a substance osa similar description, and which,
among Oriental philosophers, constitutes their fifth
element. See note on b. i. 846. But is a rigid ad-
herence to an apparent homogeneity of structure, a
stern inflexible defiance of all the powers of chemical
ingenuity to produce a decomposition, be the test and
criterion of elementary bodies, the aeid and natron,
or soda, which constitute the basis of common salt,
have a better title to such an appellation than any
substance whatever; for as yet we know of no pro-
cess, whether of art or nature, by which either of
them can be formed, or decomposed. And yet no
one doubts that these are compound bodies, although
they have hitherto eluded every analytic attempt.
The magnetic aura has long been considered as no·
thing more than a modification of the electric 3 but

the electric itself is a compound: and Dr. Gren,
professor at Hane, has written an able treatise upon
this subject, which has deservedly passed through,
at least, three editions; in which he clearly proves
that the electrie aura is a combination of light and
caloric, or elementary heat; that it may be com-
pounded and decompounded in bodies, and actually
is so in the various proeesses of smehing, combus-

the phaenomena, both of magnetism and electri-
city, to be produced by the simultaneous action of
two distinct fluids. See his very valuable Traite
Elementaire de Physique. There are various animals
endowed with eigans, that seem to possess a power
of sem-ming these auras, and perhaps there are no living
animals altogether destitute ofsuch organs ε although
in the torpedo, gymnotus electricus‚ and such do-
mestic animals as cats and rats, this extraordinary
power appears to exist in a greater degree than in
others. It seems probable, moreover, that the elec-
tric fluidis secreted from a certain set of glands dis
persed over the bodies of such animals, or from the
brairi itself. The secretiori of'a gas of any kind has
not indeed been hitherto fairly detected 3 but air has
been frequently found so largely combined with se-
ereted substances, as to render it probable that the

ply with respect to the gasses of which air is a com—
pound. The torpedo is endowed with organs which
have a close resemblance to the voltaic pile 3 and if
this structure be injured by the division of its nerves,
the torpefying effect is lost. The galvanio and electric
auras appear to be the same ; at least, the difference is
so minute as to elude all detection: it is almost re·
duced to a certainty, moreover, that this common aura
constitutes the nervous fluid 3 and in man at least it
should seem therefore to be secreted from the brain‚
and hence diffused over the body by the course of the
nerves. In passing through different organS, how-
