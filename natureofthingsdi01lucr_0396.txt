DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. Π.

Et procursus item proclive volubilis exstat.

Omnia postremo, quae puncto tempore cernis

Diffugere, ut fumum, nebulas, flammasque, necesse est,

Si minus omnia sunt 6 laevibus atque rotundis,

At non esse tamen perplex1s indupedita3

Pungere utei possint corpus, penetrareque saxa,

Nec tamen haerere inter se3 quod quisque videmus

460

Sentibus esse datum ε facile ut cognoscere possiS‚

Non 6 pe1·plexiS‚ sed acutis, esse elementis.

Sed, quod amara vides eadem, quae fluvida constant,

Sudor utei maris est, minume mirabile quoiquams

Nam, quod fluvidum est, e laevibus atque rotundis

465

Esr3 et laevibus atque rotundis mixta doloris

Corpora: nec tamen haec retineri hamata necessum:

Scilicet3 esse globosa tamen, quom squalida constent,

Provolvi simul, ut possint conlaedere sensus.

Et, quod mixta putes magis aspera laevibus esse

The commentator upon Cretch¹s translation has
justly observed, that these verses form a material part
of the argument of Lucretius, and expresses his sur-
prize that Creech has omitted theinn his version;
more especially, as he has retained the original verses
corresponding to them in his Latin edition. The
fact is, that the interpreter-s have been divided upon
their autlienticity and purity. Lambinus has marked
them off as ncedless and inelegant. Faber has dis-

carded them altogether, as the impertinent inser-
tion of some scribe. Nardins, Fayus, Havercamp‚
and Wakefield, bave all, however, retained them in the
text : and upon their authority, as well as sor the addi-
tional illustration which they afford, I have suffered
them to remain, and allotted them a place in the trans-
lation. Mareheffl, probably from the indecision of the

crines, vhas retained the more vulgar reading of sensibus
sor unsih-uu and of course omitted the reference to the
briar,containedin the secondline nfthe abochuotation :
Non gli abbiano intrigati accio sian' atti
A punger gli occhj 6 a penetra)- ne’ sassi
