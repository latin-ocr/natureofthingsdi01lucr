THE NATURE OF THINGS. ’9

And, living, thail the cheerful light of day 2— 5

Thee, Goddess, at thy glad approach, the winds,

The tempests fly: dedalian Earth to thee

And when thou spred’st thy mantle forth on hie,
The waters play, and pleasant lands appeam,
And heavens laugh, and all the world shewes joyous
cheer.

Then doth the daedale earth throw forth to thee,
Out of her fruitful lap, abundant flowres :
And then all living wights, soon as they see
The spring breake forth out ofhis lusty bowres,
They all do learn to play the paramours :
First do the merry birds, thy pretty pages,
Privily prticked with thy lustful powres,
Chirp loud to thee out of their leavy cages,

And thee, their mother, call to coole their kindly rages.

Then do the salvage beasts begin to play
Their pleasant frisks‚ and loath their wonted food ;
The lions roar, the tigres loudly bray ;
The raging bulls rebellow thro’ the wood,
And, breaking forth, dare tempt the deepest flood,
To come where thou dost draw them with desire z
So all things else that nour-ish vital blood,
Soone as with fury thou doost them inspire,

In generation seeke to quench their inward fire.

So 311 the world by thee at first was made,
And daily yet thou doost the same repaire ς
Ne ought on earth that merry is and glad,
Ne ought on earth that lovely is and faire,
But thou the same for pleasure didst prepare.
Thou art the root of all that joyous is,
Great god of men and women, queene of th’ ayne,
Mother of laughter‚ and well-spring of bliss,
O grant that of my love at last 1 may not misse.

The commencement of this addi-ess is also imitated
by Sir W. Jones, in the opening of his Caissa t

Thoujoy ofall below and all above,

Mild Venus, queen of laughter‚ queen ,of love,
Leave thy bright island, where on many 3 rose,
And manya pink, thy blooming train repose-

But it would be impossible to enumerate all the
copies, to which, in different languages, this exqui-
Vox.. Ι.

site address has given birth. One of the best I have
met with in any foreign tongue is that of Metastasio,
beginning thus
Scendi propizia
Col tuo splendore
O bella Venere
Madra d’amore :
O bella Venere
Che sola sei
Piacer degli uomini

E degli dei, &c-

It seems probable, however, that Lucretius him-
self is an imitator in the commencement of this ad-
dress, and that his eye was directed to the following
verses in the orphic hymn to Venus, or Aphrodite:

Παντα ’γαρ εκ ersom εστιν-’γεννας δε τοι ‘rr-aura
Οσσ-οι τ’ εν ουροινῳ εστι, και εν ’γαιῃ πολυκαμπῳ

Er ποντῳ τε, βυθω τε.

From thee are all things ;-all things spring from thee
In heaven above, the many-peopled earth,
In ocean, or th’ abyss-

Ver. 6. Thee, Goddess, a! thy glad approach, the
«mincis,

The tempestsfly :—] Mueh of Lucretius has been
copied or imitated, as I have just observed, by poete
in all ages and nations. An obvious imitation of these,
and the two following lines, are to be met with in
the very beautiful and animated Spanish poem, en·-
titled Araucana, by Alonzo Ercilla, 3 bard of much
celebrity‚ who flourished towards the close of the
sixteenth century, and with whom the English reader
is in some measure acquainted, by the abstract Mr.
Hayley has given of this gallant and spirited pro-
duction, in Vol. IV. of his “ Potens and PLAYs.''
The subject of this epic is the warfare between the
Spanish invading troops and the undaunted natives of
Arnum, a district in the province of Chili in South
America- The Indian demon, Epamanon, had ap-
peared in most fearsul arr-ay over the Spanish forces,
