DE RERUM NATURA.

' Lm. Ι.

Hac ratione tibi pereunt primordia rerum:

Fiet, utei risu tremulo concussa cachinnent,

Et lacrumis salsis humectent ora, genasque.

Nunc age, quod super est, cognosce, et clarius audi:

920

Nec me animi fallit, quam sint obscura3 sed acri

Percussit thyrso laudis spes magna meum cor,

Et simul incussit suavem mi in pectus amorem

Musarum: quo nunc instinctUS, mente vigenti

Avia Pieridum peragro loca, nullius ante

925

Trita solo: juvat integros adcedere funteis,

 

Ver. 980. The scheme falls seff-destroy'd. ]
Nothing can be more ridiculous than to suppose
the possession of opposite qualities in compound sub-
stanceS, derIved from the possession of such opposite
qualities in the elemental atoms of nature. And yet,
if the system of Anaxagoras be true, this absurdity
must be true likewise ; and as in the case of sudden
joy, or violent agony, persons of irritable habits,
when thrown into an hysteric paroxysm, are ac-
customed, not unfrequently, to laugh and weep at
the same moment; the same extravagant effects
ought to be exhibited, with equal frequency, in many
of the atoms of which the human frame is composed.

Ver. 983. Come, now, and mark perspicuam what
remeius] The whole of this apostrophe to
Memmius is beautiful beyond expression; and has
been imitated, in almost every line, by a variety of
the most elegant and accomplished of ancient and
modern poets.

Thus Vin-gil, in his address to his patron :

Nec sum animi dubius, verbis ea vincere magnum
Qam sit, et angustis hunc addere rebus honorem.
Sed me Parnassi deserta per ardua dulcis
Raptat amor ι juvat ire jugis, qua nulla priorum
Castaliam molli devertitur orbita clivo.

Gzo. iii. 289.

Ι, conscious of the teil, will stt-ive to raise

The lowly theme, and grace with labour'd
lays ε

Tranc’d by sweet love o’er unfrequented heights,

Where no smooth trace to Castaly invites,

I pierce the wild by mortal foot untrod,

And lonely commune with th’ Aonian god.

Sonam,

Thus also Akenside ε

but the love

Of nature and the muses bids explore

Through secret paths‚ erewhile untrod by man,
The fair poetic region, to detect

Untasted springs, to drink inspiring draughts,
And shade my temples with unfading flowers,
Cull'd from the laureat vale’s profound recess,
Where never poet gain'd a wreath before.

 

Pius. or Imm. i.
Thus too, the abbe De Lille, alluding to our

poet by name, in the following addi-ess to his muse ε

Τοὶ donc, qui, mariant la grace et la vigueur
Sais du chant didactique animer Ia langueur,
O Muse ! sijadis, dans les vers de Lucasce
Des austeres lecons tu polis la rudesse,— ‘
Viens orner un sujet plus riche, plus fertile,
Dont le charme autrefois avoit tent& Virgile.
