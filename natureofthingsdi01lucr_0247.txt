Boon I. THEssN-ATURE OF THINGS.

Would strive the ruin’d fragments to repair.
But what more obvious than that bounds exist
To matter decompounding, primal seeds
To forms defin'd coercing3 since again
All springs to birth, harmoniOUS‚ kinds from kinds,
True to their times, and perfect in their powers ?
Yet, though the principles of matter thus
Prove firm and solid, its component forms,
As air, earth, vapour, or translucent stream,
May still be soft and pliant, as combin’d‚
E'en from their birth, with less, or larges void.
But had those principles themselves been rear'd
Pliant and sofr, then whence the sturdy steel‚
> The close-compacted flint, or aught besideS‚
Of equal texture, trac'd through Nature’s realm?
Thus simple solids must be still confest 3
And all be soft‚ or rigid, as of these
In more or less concentrate mode compos'd.
To all has nature giv’n a bound precise
Of being and perfection3 and promulg’d‚
To ev’ry varying rank, her varying laws;
Urging to this, from that restraining firm.
Nought suffers change : the feathery tribes of heaven,
Bear, on their glossy plumes, through ev'ry class,

The same fixt hues that first those classes stamp’d.>
