the worship of fire, which wasjustly supposed to be
representative of the sun ; a system of religion which,
prior to tbe introduction of the Christian, pervaded
almost all nations, and which is still predominant in
South America, as well as in many other regions.
The temples dedicated to the sun, or the deity of fite,
were each ofthem denominated a Pyramid, which is
almost literally Pi—Ur-Am-Ait, and with the con-
traction P’-Ur-Am-Ait-“ the place of inspiration
of the radiant Ham,'' or “ Ham the Sun.'' They
were built upon one. model, and it is easy to perceive
that this model was deduced from the figure of an
ascending flame of fine, which originates with a broad
basis, and terminates in a pointed apex. Egypt and
Hindu abound with bui'dings ofthis description, and
the pagodas of China do not essentially vary from it.
Hercules, who is a deity of high antiquity among the
eastern nations‚ and in reality is only another name for
Jupiter or Ham, is denominated from radicals alto-
gether analogous with the term Pyramid5 for itis
literally Ur-Cal-Es, “an eminence dedicated to the
effulgence of fire ;'’ or rather, “ an ascending flame of
fire.’' And the descendants of the Heraclidae in
India are to this day denominated Surya-Bans, which
is literally “ children of the Sun.'' This appeliation
indeed, children or descendants of the Sun, of Xurh,
or Jupiter Ammon, was in a morelrestricted sense con-
ferred upon the heroes of antiquity alone3 but iu a
more general sense upon all mankind, since Hammon,
or Ham the Sun, was worshipped as the common
father of all. And hence the fable alluded to by our
poet, in the verse immediately fomgoing, of mankind
having descended from heaven or the sun, by means of
a golden chain appended from the etherial regions
for this purpose.

While the Sun was thus at first admired and af-
terwards worshipped for his splendour and power,
the serpent also, in the very same peiiod of the world,
attracted an equal degree of notice as an emblem of
providence and protection ; and was supposed iu
consequence hereos to possess, in a superior degree,
the qualities of wisdom and prudence. The beautiful

and variegated scales of this reptile seem at first to
have engaged the attention and admiration of man-
kind ; and its power of envelopingits food or prey in
a complete circle of dcfence, to have laid the founda-
tion for its moral character, and the reverence which
was paid to it afterwards. As an emblem of divine
protection‚ we find it therefore hieroglyphically re-
presented as encompassing the great mundane egg»
while floating on the waters of the deluge‚ both in
Egyptian and Hindu memorials. The serpent in
some hieroglyphics, and particularly on the walls of
the great temple of ancient Thebes, is exhibited with
wings, or as a draco volans ; and when sustaining
this figure, the same emblem of providential pro-
tection is continued, by its hovering with its wings
extended over the egg or ark that is represented as
floating below. The Egyptians denominated the
serpent (3023) hoph, whence the Greeks derive
their Οφις. And when in process of time this rep-
tile became deified, he was called Hob, Oub, or
Ob-El, “the Serpent-God ;’' and the temples or
buildings erected to his worship, which instead of
being eones, like the pyramid or temple of the Sun,
were cylindrical, were each of them termed an
Obelisk, Ob-El-Es-Ca‚ “ a temple of the radiant or
illustrious Serpeut-God.” From the name of this
deity the Greeks derive their Pelops, P’-El-Ops,
“ the oxacle of the Serpent-God ;'' Pelope in Phry-
gia, Pelopia, Pelopea daughter of Thyestes son of
Pelops, and a vast variety of other names. Pelops,
in Diod. Sic. i. 317, edit. Wessel, is said to have
been enamoured of Hippodamia, the beautiful daugh-
tei· of AEnom'aus, and to have put all his rivals to
death in order to obtain her 3 which he eventually ac-
complished. Who does not see in this fable, and un-
der these names, an emblem ofthe ark or Hippa, built
or created by Noah, and borne up and protected by
a serpent or drag-on, either hovering over it or coiled
around it, together with its safe deposit on mount
Araxat, and the triumph of the Serpent or ophite
worship? AEnom'a'us is Ain-Am-Ees, “the fountains
of Ham the Sun ;’' and Hippodamia, Hip-Ad-Am,
