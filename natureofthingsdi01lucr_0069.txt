THE LIFE OF LUCRETIUS. lv

virtue: the indiguity of the pursuit‚ and the fallacy of the enjoy-

From “ the cool, sequestered val& of his own retirement hc fre-
quently took a pleasure in looking at the busy, bustling world, at a
distance: not, as he expressly observes, that the dangers to which the
distracted multitude is exposed, afl'ord us any delight, but that it is

But, for the body, freedom from disease,

And sweet‚ unanxious quiet for the mind ?—
And little claims the body to be sound:

But little serves to strew the paths we tread

With joys beyond e'en nature's utmost wish.
What though the dome be wanting, whose proud walls
A thousand lamps irradiate‚ propt sublime

By frolic forms of youths in massy gold,
Flinging their splendours o'er the midnight feast?

Though gold and silver blaze not o'er the board‚
