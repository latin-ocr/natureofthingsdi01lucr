THE NA'I'URE OF THINGS.

199

Who deems primordial atoms esser can rest,

And, testing, urge through matter motion still,

Far wandt rs from the truth.

Primordial seeds

Through space unfathom’d as their ssight they wing,

From their own gravitating pow'r must pas&

Or blows extrinsic3 each o'er each, alike‚

Casual prevails: for oft the mass of seeds

That prone descends‚ with seeds repugnant meet

90

In contest tough‚ and distant far rebound.

Nor wondrous this, of firmest texture form’d‚

And nought t' obstruet the retro-cursive ssight.

And though thou trace the seeds unequal heap’d

Of primal matter, still, reflect‚ th’ entire

95

Knows nought of bottom‚ nought of spot profound

VVhere they may rest collected: space throughout

From human mould we* reap our daily bread.
The globe around earth's hollow surface
shakes‚

And is the ceiling of her sleeping sons.
Ver. 82. —lamp ⁰f lise, ] The phrase is
strictly oriental. Thus, Sam. ΙΙ. xx. 17. “ Thou
shalt no more accompany us to battle, lest thou quench
the lamp of lsrael.'' So Luke ii. 3²· ‘⁴ A light to
illumine the Gentiles, and the glot-y of thy people Is-
rael.'’ So the sentimental Sadi, in his ‘¹ Book of
Apoththegms :’'

 

No light to him his lamp oflfi² shall yield,
Who learns the liar’s subtle arms to wield.

In the following verses, Polignac has borrowed,
but not expanded the idea :

 

frigida mors extinxit flammea ὐἱέι
Semina, coele’stisque evanuit halitus aurae.
Auri-Lucu. v. 966.

Theflaming seeds of list> were quench’d in death ;
And heaven’s own spirit vanish'd with the bream.

 

Ver. 85. —Primordial seezls

From their own gravitatitzgpow'r must pass,
Or blows extrinsic ;

 

] The poet here cnu-
merates the two first modes of motion common to ma-
terial atoms, and admitted by Epicurus, of which a
more particular account has already been given in
note on ver. 63 of this book.
