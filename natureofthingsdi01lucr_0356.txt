DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. ΙΙ,

Multiplexque loci spatium transcurrere eodem

Tempore, quo solis pervolgant fulgura coelumt

Nam neque consilio debent tardata morari,

Nec persectari primordia singula quaeque,

Ut videant, qua quidque geratur cum ratione.

At queidam contra haec, ignarei, materiai

Naturam non posse, desim sine numine, reddi

Tanto opere humanis rationibus admoderate ;

Tempora mutare annorum, frugesque creare ;

Et jam caetera, mortaleis quae suadet adire,

Ipsaque deducit, dux vitae, dia Voluptas,

 

all its hypotheses, strenuously opposes this beauti-
ful and correct illustration. Breve Spositione di tutta
l’Opera di Lucretio. The principle affin-med by
Lucretius, however, is corroborated by the best ex-
periments, and the soundest inductions of the most
able astronomers and physiologists of modern timeS,
and is an additional proof of the general precision
and truth of the Epicurean system. It is, however,
becoming a fashion in philosophy at present, (for
philosophy has its fashions, as well as other studies‚)
to decry this materiality of light, to establish which
the atomic philosophers have written so many vo-
lumes, and Galileo, Newton, Nieuwentyt, and Brad-
ley, have made so many experiments: and rather to
give credit to the doctrine of Aristode, as revived by
Des Cartes and Euler, that light is produced, not
by an emission of particles from luminous bodies, but
by a vibratory motion excited by them, and propa-
gated through the elastic medium of the air, οι· ethe-
rial fluid ς by which means the eye is operated upon
in seeing, as the ear is in hearing.

But whilst this doctrine seems to be once more re-
viving on the Continent, and even in our own country,
through the indefatigable efforts of Dr. Young,
the experiments and reasonings of Mr. Melville, and

Dr. Horsley, in vol. LVIII. and LX. of the Philo-
sophical Transactions——are still, in my opinion, unsub-
verted, and insubvertible, and establish the Newtonian
hypothesis on a basis which must subsist for ever.
VVhether or not Lucretius himself had any mode
os ascertaining the exact velocity of light, or merely
wrote from a well—founded conjecture of such velo-
city, 1 know not. If he had, his experiments have
never reached us, and the probability is, that no
such experiments existed. Galileo, indeed, was the
first philosopher who is known to have attempt-
ed any experiment upon this subject, and even his
exertions were not crowncd with complete suc-
cess ; nor was it, till little more than a century ago,
that any plan was devised‚ which was likely to
answer such a purpose. This plan consisted in noticing·
the variations of the eclipses of Jupiter’s satellites,
from the time calculated in the tames, both when the
earth approached in her orbit‚ and receded froin this
planet. The first experiments were made at the
Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris ε and it was at
length ascertained, that when the earth is between
the sun and Jupiter, the satellites of this latter planet
appear to us to be eclipsed about eight minutes
sooner than they could be, according to the tables of
