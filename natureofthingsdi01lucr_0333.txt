Boon ΙΙ. ΤΗΕ NATURE OF THINGS. 185

Through what dread dark, what perilous pussuits 1 5
Pass ye this round of being I-know γε not
Of all γε toil for nature nothing asks
But for the body freedom from disemse,
And sweet, unanxious quiet, for the mind?
And little claims the body to be sound ε 20

But little serves to strew the paths we tread

Oblii Ie noje audate, e non affretti Let thunders roll, and nimble light⁷nings fly ς ’
Le sue miserie in aspettando i mali. Yet heed not you the threat'nings of the sky.

Nulla curi, se’l ciel tuoni o saetti3 This, this is wisdom ; hence each blessing flows :
Minacci egli a sua voglia, e infiammi strali. This Nature bids, and this the path she shows.
Questo ὲ saper, questa ὲ felice vita : HooLE.

Her sacred laws, and slight her high command? and hence the following epigram 0f Athenaeusz

Insensate he who wastes his bloomy prime, AvOpmm μοχθειτε τι χειρονα, xm ἒια κερῧος
Nor tastes the transient gifts of flecting time. Απληστον vsa-am αρχετε και πολεμιων ;
