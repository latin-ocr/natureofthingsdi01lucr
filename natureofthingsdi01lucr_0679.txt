Boon III. THE NATURE OF THlNGs. 529

These all, like meaner mortuis, rest in peace——
When hoary hairs DEMOCRITUS foi-ewam'd 1075

His mental powers were hastening to dewy,

Quick he uprose, and midway met his fate-—
E⁷en he is fall'n, his lamp of life extinct‚

Th' illustrious EmeURUs, whose vast mind

Triumphant rose o’er all 111611, and excell'd-‚ 1080

As, in the heavens, the sun excels the stass.
And dost thou murmur, and, indignant, die,

Whose life9 while living> scarcely death exceeds Ρ

 

brt'ghler once ame'ilil the host
Of Angeb, than that star (Lucifer) the stars among.
PAR. Losr, vii. 13²-

fect, and the render may be pleased by an opportu-
nity of comparing the Portugueze bard, both with
the Roman and the Spanish. Venus is advancing

through the cerulean vault of heaven to 1116 throne
of Jupiter :

E como hia a frontada do caminho,

Tam fei-mosa no gesto se mostrava‚

Qe as estre-llas, o 660, e o ar vezinho,

E tudo quanto a via namorava.

Dos 011105 onde faz seu filho o ninho

Huns espiritos vivos inspiram,

Com que os polos gelados acendia,

E tornavado fogo a essexa fria.
Lusum, Cant. ii.

Her radiant eyes such living splendours cast,

The spat-kling stars were brighteued as she past ;.
The frozen pole with sudden streamlets flow’d,
And as the burning zone with servom· glow'd.

The paralielism of idea in th: following verse-S,
from 30 ancient song in Percy’s collection, is very
peculias. It is entitled‚ from its opening, “ You
meanei· beauties.”

You meaner beanties of the nightv
Which pom-ly satisfy our eyes,
More by your number 11130 your light,
Like common pcople qs the ἀίω-’-
What are γε when the mom deth risa· Γ
So when my mistris 511311 be seen
In sweetnesse of her looks and minde ;
By νει-1116 first, then choico a queen ;
Teu me if 5116 wns not designde
Th’ eflipff, andglmy of her kindc ? B. i. 231.

the Portugueze readcr will see at once, that although tation Of 011¹· poet, 21⁵ it occurs in Horace :

it has* considerable merit so far as it goa, by omit-
ting much of the picture contained in the original,
it falls very far below it in general worth. Milton
has an image somewhat similar to this of Lucretius,
and pei-hapa, immediately derived from him, in the fol-
lowing passage, in which he describes chiriziz as

Vox.. 1.

Micat inter omnes
Julium sidus, velut inter ignes
Luna minores.
Lm. i. Od. 12,
With night's least lampa the moon compare :—

Such 'mid the stars the Julian star.
