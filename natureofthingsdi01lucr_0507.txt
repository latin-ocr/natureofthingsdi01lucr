‘⁶ the ark of the supreme Ham.¹’ AEnom'a'us is,
therefore, only another name for Ham, or Noah the
progenitor of Ham : and Hippodamia was frequently
an appellation for Aphrodite, Venus, or the fabric
which Ham and his father constructed3 and which
may, with the utmost propriety, be entitled the off-
spring of either of them. The city of Pelopia men-
tioned above, was the same with Thyatira, which, as
previously noticed, was sacred also to Venus.

⁴ I have already observed, that between the arkitc
and solar worship there subsisted the closest degree of
intermixture and combination3 and that, from the
origin of solar worship itself, this must necessarily
have been the case. But from the observations im-
mediately preceding, it evidently appears that at least
an equal degree of intimacy must have taken place
between the arkite and the ophite idolatry3 the ser-
pent being regarded merely as the protecting power
of the ark or erech, enveloping it with its pliant vo-
lumes, or hovering over it with its guardian wings.
Yet, from the lustre and coruscation ofits scales, and,
more particularly still, from its occasionally forming
the figure of a complete circle, it became also a type
of the Sun himself, and was not unfrequently regarded
as such. Hence the word Europa, is by analy'sis
Eur-Op, or Eur·Oph‚ “the Serpent of the Sun.''
And hence we obviously account for the connexion,
intertexture‚ and occasional confusion of these three
distinct systems of idolatry‚ and not unfrequently
trace a reference to all of them in the same proper
names of cities or family. Thus Cecrops, king of
Athens, means (Ca-Cur—Ops‚ and contractedly
Ca-C¹r-Ops,) “ the temple of the Solar Ops,” or,
‘⁶ the Serpent of the Sun.'' But Cecrops is seigned
to have been the descendant of Erectheus, while
Erectheus, on the contrary, is (Erech-Theus or
Theut) “ Theus the lord or chief of the erech or
ark.'’ In like manner I have observed‚ that Venus
and Theut or Theus were the same deity, only with
a different gender3 yet one of the sacrifices offered to
Venus was entitled (Ζωκορισι) Zacoria, and her priests
were entitled (Ζακοροι) Zacori; but Zacoria and

Zacori are obviously borrowed from Za‹Cu1·, which
radically means ‘⁶ the Sun,'' or, “the glorious Lord
ofday.'’ From the Chaldaic term Cur, the Greeks
derive their Κυριος, which was a title of honour, and
Κρητη (the island of Crete), as well as Curium a town
in CypruS‚ both of which were sacred to Venus.
From the same term, also, is derived the Κουρητες,
Curetes, Cur-Ait—Es, (“ the emanations of the Su-
preme Sun,’') or priests of Jupiter, to whose office
our poet has already alluded, ver. 614 of the present
book. Hence Creas or Creasna, “ the Sun,'' in the
Esse tongue3 Cheres in the Egyptian ; Cores among
the Persian53 and Cora among the Peruvians. In
like manner, Kirclier applies the terms Baal and
Bel, by which the idolatrons Canaanites designated
their supreme deity, the Sun, to Venus, and repre·
sents him with his lower parts of the form of a fish ι
but Bel or Baal, being masculine, he is more pro-
perly Thoth, Oannes, or Noah. Yet Κυέελη (Cu-
Bel, or “ the temple of Bel'⁷) is an undoubted ap-
pellation of Venus in the character of Da-Meter, or
‘⁵ the great parent of all things.''

From this ingenious theory, connected with a
general survey of ancient history and mythology, on
which I have dwelt the longer in an individual note,
that I might bring the whole into one comprehen-
sive point of view, it should seem that al] the different
systems of idolatry that have been exhibited in past,
and are perhaps exhibiting in present ageS‚ ramify
from the three radical fountains of arkite, solar, and
ophite worship ; all of which were adopted at a very
early period after the deluge, and were propagated
over the globe, on the dispersion of the sons of Chus,
in every different directioa, after the ruin of their
celebrated tower and city of Babel: and we see
obviously from what quarter the two most popular
opinions of the origin of mankind, here adverted to
by our poet, were derived—to'wit, their descent
from the sun, or the etherial regions; and their
creation from the waves of the ocean. They were
also occasionally stated, and that too not upon phi-
losophic principles, but mythological fable, to have
