Ver. 621. Her priests are eunuchs]-—There is a
fiction recorded by many ancient writers, that those
-who had determined to devote themselves to the
priesthood of Cybele, or the Idaea Mater, were
initiated into the office by a kind of baptism in the
river Gallus, a considerable stream in Phrygia: the
waters of which had no sooner approached their lips
than they became instantly delirious, and castrated
themselves. Many ofthe Christian fathers have al·
luded to this tradition. St. Jerom has related the
whole story as a truth ς and Tertullian, from this effect
of the Phrygian river, denominates the high priest of
this goddess Archi-gallus.

There is no necessity, however, for-attributing to
the waters of the Gallus any such mii-acle. The en-
thusiasm engendered by superstition basin all ages
been eqnal to such an effect. The priests of Baal, in
the midst of their solemnium, were accustomed to
{honr aloud‚ and mangle themselves with knives and
lancets, 1 Kings‚ xviii. 283 and long before this
period, a similar kind of penance and mortification
was so common even among tlie Hebrews themselves,

in the midst of their funeral ceremonies, that Moses
was expressly commanded byithe Almighty to pro-
hibit so barbarous a rite. A similar prohibition was
also contained in the laws of Solon, and composed a
part of the Roman law of the twelve tables, Mulieres
genas ne radrmto, neve lessam funeris ergo habento. The
devotees of Syria, the votan’es of Isis, and Bellona,
were all equally severe upon themselves, yet none or
them have exceeded the fakirs of Hindustan. In the
time of our Saviour we learn, Matt. xix. 12.

that there were among the Jews some “ who
“ had made themselves eunuchs for the king-
“ dorn of heaven’s sake;'’ and it is well known, that
several centuries afterwards, Origen submitted volun—
tarily‚ and for the same reason, to the same barbarous
punishment. Origen, however, appears to have had
more to plead in his favour, than many others who had
equally mangled themselves. He had entered into
a vow of celibacy, which, from being possessed ofa
warm and sanguineoustemperament, he did not at all
times find it easy to adhere to. His own confessions

indeed state him to have been frequently tempted by
concupiscent impulses ; and feurful of his being led
asti-ay by their violence, he emasculated himself to
preserve his virtue. In thisrespcct, however, he was
peculiarly unfortunate3 for after having submitted to so
cruel an operation, he was condemned by an ecumeni-
