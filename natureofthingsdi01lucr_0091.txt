THE LIFE OF LUCRETIUS. lxxvii

Let it not be conceived, however, that I hereby enter into ’111οι1113-
tification of this tenet. In 3110111119,- the degree os its universahty, I
only mean to contend, that whatever bc its opprobrium with respect
to religion, or its inconsequence with respect to ratiocination, the Epi-
cureans are not more guilty than the greater part ofancient, and several
modern, philosophers. There are three systems which hare been alter-
nately advanced to avoid the supposed absurdity osthe proposition thus
univcrsally appealed to, “ that nothing can proceed srom nothing‚'' or, in
other words, that the world was produced by an eternal and intelligent
” power from non-enti-ty; yet they all, ifI mistake not, plunge us into an
absurdity ten times more deep and inextricable. The first is that con-
tended for by all the old atomio sehools, that matter is, in itself‚ neces-
sarily and essentially eternal. But by such a dogma we are’put into
possession oftwo co—eternal,co-existent, and independent principles, des-
titute of all relative connexion, and common medium of action. The
second, which has had even more espousers than the first, asserts, that
the universe is an expansior] of the essenee of the Supremo Creator.
But under this belief, the Creator himself becomes material, or in other
words, matter itself becomes the Creator, a doctrine not only very gene-
mlly advanced by former philosoplwrs, but lately rcrived and re-accre-v
dited on the continente, although 1111111010111-11110111111111111111001011110010οἃ.
The third hypothesis is that of the idealists ; to wit, that there is no such
thing as a material or external world ; that the existence ofman consists
of nothing more than impressions and ideas, or of pure incorporea] spi-
rit which surveys every thing 111 the same insubstantia] manner as the
visions of a dream. Gcrniany has still some advocates for this tenet,·
the Kantian philosophy, or as the professor at K'onigsburg prefers it
should be called, the Criticism of Pure Reason, has an obvious inclina,-
