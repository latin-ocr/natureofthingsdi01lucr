THE NATURE OF THINGS.

Or, if the humour urge them, is but air,

And hence, that useless all the lore vve bring :—-

Oft Hows the boast from love of praise alone.

For when of home debarr'd, from every haunt

Of man cut off, with conscious guilt o'erpower’d,

Midst every ill such boasters still survive:

Still fell new victims, and th' infernal powers

Implore with black oblations;
Religion thus with ten-fold force propell'd.

Through doubtful dangers, hence, through straits severe

Pursue the race of man 3 then sole ascends

most Oriental nauem, and even the Druids of our
own country. Zoroastres commanded the offering
of prayers to Arimanius the principle of evil, as well
as to Oromasdes the principle of good : and the bra-
mins of the present day, adore Sem, the destroyer
of things, as well as Veshnu, the creating and pre-
serving spirit; and regard him, indeed, as‘coequal
aud coeternal with the latter. The Jews themselves
were not unfrequently guilty of the same idola-
trous conduct: and even Solomon, in the midst
of his prosperity, did not refrain from paying
divine honours to Moloeh‚ the evil demon of the
Ammonites. See 1 Kings, cap. xi. v. 7. Hence Mil-

Of solomon he led by fraud to build
His temple right against the temple of God,

· On that opprobrious hill, and made his grove
The pleasant valley of Hinnom, Tophet thence,
And black Gehenna called, the type of hell.

Ver. 56. Through doubfful clanget-s, hence, through
straits severe
Pursue the racc os man ; then sole ascends
Truth from the lowliest bosom‚—] To the same
effect, Ariosto‚ in the following stanza :

Alcun non puo saper da chi sia amato
Qando felice in su la rota siede :
Pero, c' ha i veri, ei finti amici a lato,
’ Che mostran tutti una medesma fede.
Se poi si cangia in tristo il licto stat0,
Volta la turba adulatrice il piede ε
E quel, che di cuor ama, riman forte,
Ed ama il suo signor dopo la morte.

None see the beart when placed in prosperous state,

On Fortune’s wheel, such numbers round them
wart

Of true and seeming friends ; when these no less

By looks declare that faith which those possess.

But should to fair, succeed tempestuous skies,

Behold! how soon each fawning suppliant flies ι
