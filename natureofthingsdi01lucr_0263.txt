Hence those, in FIRE, who trace the rise of things,

And nought but FIRE3 or those for Ain who strive

The system, however, most consentaneous with
this of Anaximenes, of any I have met with in mo-
dern times, is that of M. Humboldt, a German che-
mist, of no mean reputation, as detailed in a treatise
published in 1801, entitled “ Versuclie iiber die Che-
mische Zerlegung des Luftkreises.” In this publi-
cation, the author supposes the solid parts of the
earth to have been precipitated from a kind of gross
and feculent atmosphere during the existence of a
chaos. This idea is, indeed, fanciful; but the au-
thor's chemical facts and experiments are entitled to
serious attention ; and particularly those which relate
to the quantity of carbon contained in common at-
mospheric air, here calculated at three-twentieths of
the whole, and which seem to support the doctrine

of the oxygeneity of light.

IVhofhndZysancy ,-] Such was the opinion of
many philosophers, but particularly of Thales of Mi·

 

letus, the contemporary and intimate friend of Solon,
and who consequently flourished about five centuries
before the commencement of the Christian era. He
was the founder of the Ionic school, and the first who
attempted 1ο calculate eclipses. His hypothesis of
the origin of all things from water, has been adopted
by some men of letters in every age, but particularly
among the earlier of the German chemists, as Para7
celsus, and Van Helmont. It was the general belief
among the Hebrew sages, in consequence of the
Mosaic assertion, “ that the spirit ofGod moved upon

the face of the wartnsss' (the only substance inti-
mated to exist) when engaged in the work of crea-
tion. And for the same reason it has formed a part
of the creed of Basil Valentine, and many of the fa-
thers of the Christian church in later periods. Thales,
however, in all probability, drew his hypothesis from
observing how very large a portion of even the hardest
and most solid substanccs is composed of water;
and from the cohesion which is produced in the driest
and most subtile earths and powders of every* de-
scription upon its introduction.

Mythology has also adopted the element of wa-
ter as the great source and origin of all things, as
well as philosophy ; and the espousers of this mytho-
logie tenet have been very numerous and plausible.
1t is repeatedly admitted by Homer: and is, proba-
bly, in consequence hcreof, again controverted by
our poet in b. ii. 1169. Allegorically‚ indeed, Lu-
cretius himself, in the opening of the present book,
addi-esses Venus as the common parent of all things :
but the origin of Venus, or Dea-Mater (Δημητηρ), ac-
cording to the avowcd dictates of all ancient tradi-
tion, was from the main; and it is highly probable
that Mr. Bryant. is correct in considering her as a
mere type of the ark that floated over the immense
surface of water that covered the whole earth during
the general deiuge, and contained within its womb
the radicals of all future animal and vegetable exist-
ence. See this idea enlarged upon in the note on
b. ii. ver. 1167.
