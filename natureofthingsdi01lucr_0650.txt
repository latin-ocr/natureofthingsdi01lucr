Ver. 924. “ ‘Thy babes bclov'd,

“ The dulcet kiss ] I must not here for·-
bear to quote a beautiful passage of Homer, towards
which, as Lambinus has justly obseroed, Lucretius

 

 

appears to have thrown his eye in this exquisite de-
lineation, and whence, perhaps, he drew the· rudi-
ments of one of his most pathetic traits :

Οτι μαλ’ ου Smenos, ος aha-rom μαχοιτο,

003, ΕΠ ,um wath& '‘Ton vovm‘ffl παππαζῦἶὶἶίῖ

Ελθοντ’ εκ πολεμον), και omn,- δηϊοτῆτος IL. E, 437.

Know thou, whoe’ei· with heavenly power conteuds‚
Short is his date, aud soon his glory ends.

From fitlds of death, when late he shall retii-c,
No infant on his knees shall call him sire. Pon.

But though Lucretius may, perham, with respect
to one idea, be a copyist of Homer, virgil is a far
closer copyist of Lucretius. Yet he has written, as
Dr. VVarton judiciously asserts, with less tenderncss
aud effect :

Interea dulces pendent circum oscula nati :

Casta pudicitiam servat domus. Giaoxc. ii. 525.
He feels the father's and the hushaud’s bliss, »
His iufants climb, aad struggle fot· a kiss ;

His modest house sm‘ct chastity maintains.

Wanos.

Otu· own language boasts of a variety ofimita-
tions of this elegiae and exquisite passage ι of which

several are possessed of great feeling and simpli-

city. The following is from the pathetic muse of
Gray ε
For them, no more the blazing hearth shall burn,
Or busy housewg'fe ply her evening care ;
No children run, to lisp their sire’s return,

Or climb ht's knecs, the envied kt'Js to share.

The two last lines are, very nearly, a vei-bal transla-
tion. The next imitation to which I shall refer, is
by Thomson : it is freex· than that of Gray ; but exe-
cuted with equal felicity. It occurs in his VVinter, to
which season it particularly adver-ts ς

In vain for him th' qfficious wife prepares

The fire fair-blazing, and the vestment warm ε

In vain, his little children, peeping out

Into the mingled storm, demand the-1⁸1· sire

'xVith tears of artless innocence. Alas ἔ

Nor wife nor children more shall he behold,

Μη- friends, nor sacred home. Ver. 31 1.

It is not unlikely that Thomson, 'rather than Lu-
cretius, has been copied in this delineation by Klop-
stock‚ iu the following verseS, which compi-ise a
part of the meditations of the repentant Abadonna :

Soll ich gehen und schaun den mann, der dort mit
dem tede,

Und mit gedanken von jenem gericht in schrec-
kender angst ringt ?

Soll ich sehen das blut des erschlagnen ? Vielleicht‚
das er ruhig.

In den schatten der nacht forteilte, stammelnde
kinder
