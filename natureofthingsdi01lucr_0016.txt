Tumes was dragged forth from-its learned dust, and¹ its beautiesffre-- .
investigated and unfolded. On the resurrection of science, Italy first
thrcw off the mouldy shroud that enveloped· her; and here first we
behold a restoration of the labours of Lucretius. Brescia has the
honour ot'having, on this occasion, led the way, by a folio edition of
the original, correctly and sumptuously printed by Ferrandi in 1473;
Verona, Venice, and Bologna, speedily >and successfully followed.
Early in the ensuing century, various impressions appeared in France
and Germany3 and at last, under the superintendence of Creech, in
our own country, in 1695.

To enter into an examination of the comparative merits of these'dif—
ferent editions of the original, would be to overstep the bounds of
my character as a translator. It is sufficient to observe, that of those
which have hitherto appeared, the most approved, and by far· the
most correct, are Havercamp's and XVakefield's3 the latter of which
was only published in 1796, and by the elegance of its typography‚
the accuracy andro-integration of its text, and‹the rich and->com-
prehensive commentary with which it is accompanied, has amply
atoned for the tardiness with which. the merits of Luci-euius
were acknowledged in Great Britain. The Wakefield edition
has since been reprinted by M. Eichstadt at Leipsic‚ or rather
is at this time reprinting; the first volume only having hi-
therto made its appearance, which comprises the entire text, and

The popularity of Lucretius, however, has hitherto been more re·
tarded by the want of poetic talents in his translators, than from any
deficiency of original editions; and Great Britain, which was latest
