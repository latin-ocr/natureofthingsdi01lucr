DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. 111.

Sceptra potitus, effidem aliis sopitus quiete est.

Denique, Democritum, post quam matura vetustas

Admonuit memores motus languescere mentis,

‘Sponte su& leto caput obvius obtulit ipse.

Ipse Epicurus obiit, decurso‘lumine vit'ae ;

Qui genus humanum ingenio superavit, et omneis

'Restinxit, stellas exortus uti aerius sol.

'Tu vero dubitabis, et indignabere, obire,

Mortua quoi vita est prope jam vivo, atque videnti?

 

cujus ex ore prosusos

Omnis posteritas latices in carmina duxit,
Amnemque in tenueis ausa est deducere rivos
Unius faecunda bonis.

 

from whose abundant spring
Succeeding poets draw the songs they sing-J
from him they take, from him adorn their theme—s,
And into little channels cut his streams,

Rich in his stoi-e.

Vida has copied this passage as follows ι

Qos inter potitur sceptris insignis Homerus :

Hunc omnes alii observant, hinc pectore numen

Concipiunt vates, blandumque Heliconis amorem.
Ροετιε. i. 135·

Nor is it hard to cull each noble picce,

And point out every glorious son of Greece 3

Above whose numbers Homer sits on high,

And shines supreme in distant mty'esfy ,-

Whom with a reverent eye the rest regard,

And owe their raptures to the sovercign hard.

Ver. 1079. whose vast mind

Triumphum rose o'er all men, and excell’d

As, in the heavens, the sun excells she stam]
From this passage, we again trace the brave and ge—
nerous Ercilla enriching his Araucana, by infusing
its spirit aud simile into his delineation of the hea-
vcnly vision that, in a female form, appeared to con-
sole and fortify the affrighted Spaniards after the
Indian daemon Eponamon had vanished away. The
poet tells us that she was

Cubierta de un hermoso y limpio velo,
Con tanto resplendor, que al medio dia

La clar-idad del sol delante della,
Es la que certa del tiene una esu-ella. CANT. ix.

Clad in the radiante of so rich a vtil,
As made the sun’s meridiari lustre pale.
For it outshone his golden orb as far
As his full blaze outshines the twinkling star.
