BooK Ι. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 131 γ

So something still must, void of change, exist;
Or all would perish, all to nought return3 855
For what once changes, by the change alone
Subverts immediate its anterior life.
Since, then, as sung above, these all commute
Each into each, some seeds must still be own’d
That ne’er can change, or all to nought would waste. 860
Hold rather, then, such seeds exist, endow'd
With powers so curious that, as now combin'd‚
If fire they form, combine them but anew,
Add, or deduct, give motion, or subtract,
And all is air3 and changing thus, and chang'd 865
That things from things perpetual take their rise.
Nor urge, still sceptic, that each hour displays
All life protruded from the genial EARTH τ
Fed by the balmy AIR 3 by heaven's own ΗΒΕ
Matur'd3 and sav'd from pestilence, and death 870
Alone by sHowERs benignant : and that hence
Man, beast, and herbs alike exist, and thrive.
The fact we own: we own from solid food,
And crystal streams, man draws his daily breath,
Of nerve, of bone, of being else depriv'd: 87 5
But, owning, add, the compounds meet for man,
For brute, for herbage, differ in their kinds,
By different tastes discern’d: and differ thus,
