BooK ΙΙ. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 201

Boundless exists‚ as, in our earlier verse,
Deeisive prov’d, on ev'ry side immense.
Hence, then, primordial seeds through space profound 100

Surmounted soon. Hence those, through trivial space 105
Briefly repell’d, the vig’rous bond scarce broke,
With quick reunion intertwining strong,
Form the rude base of flium, and rigid steel‚
And matters firm alike: while those, beyond
Far wand’ring through the void, of feebler link 1 10
Mutual possest, the liquid air create,
And the pure light the sun perpetual pours.

Nor these the whole compose. For seeds there are
That through the boundless void for ever stray‚
Of social bond abhorrent, and in turn 1 15
Refus’d all compact in the frame of things:
