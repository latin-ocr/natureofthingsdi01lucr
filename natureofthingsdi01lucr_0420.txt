The wonderful accounts we have received of the
effecte of music in ancient times, compared with what
occur in the present day, have induced many persons
to regard the whole as fabulous: while others have
imagined that, with all our boasting, the ancients
far exceeded us in their knowledge of harmonics.
This last is certainly, however, an erroneous opinion,
for we do not know, anterior to the invention of
Guido Armine, in the thirteenth century, that musi·
cians had ever the sxnallest idea of counterpoint, or
the science of harmoniously combining the notes
of different diapasom, which has infinitely added
to the extent and perfection of the musical art.
The Greeks had, nnquestionably, three distinct ge-
nera, and perhaps a greater variety of modes than
exist in the present day ς but these genera were never
blended together so as to produce the effect of har-
mony ;—the diatonic being always employed sepa-
rately from the chmmatic, and this again from the
enharmonic, and each merely differing from the other
two by a variation in its intervals. How then comes
it to pass, if there be any truth in the records or tra-
ditions referred to by Lucretius and Dryden‚ if al-
most every passion could be either excited or allayed,
and a variety of diseases removed or mitigated by
the skilful performer in past ageS, that we so seldom
meet with the same wonderful effects in the pre-
sent day? Ι incline to believe, that much more is
narratcd of the effects of ancient music, than was ever
justified by fact3 but it would evince a most un-
reasonable scepticism, to discredit every thing that is
related upon this subject, because many of the cases

recorded ere fairly and incontrovertibly attested. Ι
incline to believe then, also, that much of this defi-
ciency of influence among ourselvcs is produced by
the very perfection stself, which the musical art has
acquired in modern tirnes; and that, on the great
mass of the pcople,—in reality, on every one who is
not a scientilic student, and capable of remarking, by
stiict and rigid attention, the harmonic relation of the
indiviclual tones of one part with those of another,—
pure and simple melody has a much more lively and

empassioned effect than the most correct and elaborate
piece of harmony, or music in parts, though per-
formed with the advantage of the most brilliant exe·
cution. Of this, indeed, the experience of every
day is a sufficient proof. Concerts of instrumenta!
music, alone, are not so generally attended upon as
those combined with vocal, in which there is less
room for the display of harmonic relations: and, if
Ι be not much mistaken, the attention of an unin-
structed audience is more rigidly fixt on a solo, whe-
ther vocal or instrumental‚ than on a trio or a glee.
The mind of. the multitude is disti-acted by the rich-
ness and variety of compound music ς and the nerv-
ous system is rather generally agitated, than particu-
larly excited to any individual passion. The grand-
est chorus in an oratorio, or the fullest finale in an
opera, produces much less impression upon >an audi-
ence, than a single song, or unsupported air; and the
Braes of Ballendyne, Logan VVater, or the Birks of
Endermay‚ give more sensible pleasure‚ than the most
laboured passage of Haydn‚ Pleyel, Giornovichi, or

vionti. It is impossible for any one not to have no-

ticed this, who has ever frequented places of public
amusement. The former are never encored, but the
latter repeatedly3 and, provided the music be de-
scriptive, or sentimental, even the merit of the voice
itself is not of extreme consequence.——Mrs. Jordan
receives as hearty a welcome as Madame Banti.
Simple, unsupported melody, is within the compre-
hension os the people at large ς but the complicated
and elaborate over-ture, or chorus, is too perplext
for thern to understand. The same thing occurs in
·Men of letters, and

other facts of a similar kind.
