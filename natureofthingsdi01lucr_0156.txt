DE RERUM NATURA.

ῘᾸΒ. Ι.

Te, Dea, te fugiunt ventei3 te nubila coeli,

Adventumque tuum: tibi suaveis daedala tellus

coelestia divum

 

Auxilia implorant, propriis nil viribus ausi.

Qos ores autem non magui denique refert,

Dum memor auspiciis cujusquam cuncta deorum

Aggrediere z Jovis neque enim nisi rite vocato

Numine, fas quicquam ordiri mortalibus altum.
Poe-nc ii. 20.

 

implore
The timely aid of some celestial power,
To guide your labours, and point out your road.
Chuse, as you please‚ some tutelary god,
But still invoke some guardian deity,
Some power to look auspicious from the sky.
To nothing great should mortals bend their care,
Till Jove be solemnly addrest in prayer.
“ Pirr-

Hence Homer and Virgil invoke the muse, with-
out any specific name, in the commencement of
their respective poems ; Vida and Klopstock‚ the
holy Ghost ; Milton, both ς Tasso and Sanazaro,
the holy Virgin; and Gesner, an impersonification
of enthusiasm. Dante and Ariosto‚ indeed, have
occasionally adopted more extraordinary invocations
still; and the objections of the critics will certainly
apply to them with but little possibility ofpalliation 3
for the former, in the third canto of his Divina Co-
media, and the latter, in the same canto of his Or-
lando Furioso, address the pagan god Apollo with
little that can be called pure allegoric allusion, and
with very much of the paraphernalia of the popular
Grecian mythology.

The cardinal Polignac, who strenuously opposed
the philosophy of the Roman bard‚ and of all other
deists or atheists, ancient or modern, in a poem en-
titled Anti-Lucretius, of which I have already given
some account in the prefnce, and who, so far as re-
lates to poetic ornaments, was a frequent copyist of
our author, did not indeed dare to imitate him in the
present instance. Like that of Vida and Klopstock‚

the invocation he has adopted is addressed to the holy
7

Ghost. It is possessed of no small share of beauty,
however; and the reader will doubtless be pleased
with an opportunity of comparing the addresses of
these antagonist poets together.

 

Te causa et regula mundi

Omnipotens, aeterna dei sapientia, virtus,

Et mens, et ratio, vitae dux optima nostrae‚

Ipsaque lux animi, te solam in vota vocabo,

Hunc ades, et vati longum da ferre laborem.

Per te cuncta suo stant ordine, cuncta videri

Tandem, et nativis possunt emergere ab umbris;

In te discendi nobis innata voluntas

Pascitur, et veri nunquam satiata cupido.

Incute vim dictis, propriamque ulciscere causam.
Ann-Luca. l. 1.

Thee the world’s great cause,

 

And guide omnipotent, eternal source

Of virtue, wisdom, intellect‚ and soul,

Our life’ssbest leader, and the mind’s sole light,
Thee only I invoke l be present now,

And aid thy poet in his vast emprize.

All, all survey'd, from thee, in order due,
Spring from the shades profound of native night.
To thee th’ innate desire, the thirst unquench'd
Of truth, of science, guide my panting breast3
Arm then thy bard, and thine own cause avenge.

Ver. ι.
Benignant Venus ! thou thesail-clad main, &c.]
The greater part of this address to Venus has been

 

by gods and men belov’d,

beautifully translated by Spenser, and introduced into
his Fairy Qeen. It occurs in B. iv. cant. 10, and
the merit of the passage induces me to transcribe it.

Great Venus ! queene of beauty, and of grace,

The joy of gods and men, that under skie

Doost fairest shine, and most adorn thy place 3

That with thy smiling looke doost pacifie

The raging scas, and mak’st the stormes to flie :

Thee, goddesse ! thee, the winds, the clowdes do
seare3
