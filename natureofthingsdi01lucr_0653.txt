Boox III. THE NATURE OF THINGS.

From every dread, and trouble. ‘⁶ Thou art safe!

“ The sleep of death protects thee ! and secures 93 5
“ From all th' unnumber’d woes of mortal life!
‘⁶ While we, alas! the sacred urn around

“ That holds thine 351168, shall insatiate weep‚

“ Nor time destroy th' eterna] grief we feel !''

Is not short pain well borne, that brings· long ease,
And lays the soul to sleep in quiet grave ?
Sleep aster toil, port after stormy seas,
Ease after war, death after life, does greatly
please.

Shakspeare has caught the spirit of the same me-
taphor, in the beginning of Hamlet’s soliloquy:

To be, or not to be ?—-that is the question—-
XVhether 'tis nomer, in the mind, to suffer

The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,

Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,

And, by opposing‚ end them ?—to die—to sleep—
No more ! and, by a slerp‚ to say we end

‘The beart-acha, and the thousand natural shocl’s
Thatflcsh is heir to :—tis α consummation

Devoutly to lm wished ,Ι

Ι cannot avoid adding to this imitation a‘most ex-
quisite sonnet of Mrs. Charlotte Smith ; as well on
account ofits sweet simplicity and pathos, as from
its being in perfect unison with the imagery of the
text :

Oh thou .' who slcep’st where hazel bands cutwine
The vernal grass, with paler violets (It-est,

I would, sweet girl! thy humble bed were mine,
And mine thy calm and enviable res!-

F or, never more, by human ills appan,

Shall thy soft spirit fruitlessly repine :

Thou canst not, ηονν, thy fondest hope resign
E’eu in the hom· that should have made thee blest ε
Light lies the turf upon thy gentle breast ;
And, lingering here, to love and sorrow true,
The youth, who ouce thy simple beart possest,
Shall mingle tears with April’s early dew,

While still, for him, shall saidsul memory save
Thy form and virtuesfmm the silent grave.

It is not improbable that this pensive poetess de-
rived the first idea of this elegant and sentimental
sonnet from the tender address of Mason to the spi-
rit of his departed and dearly-beloved wife. The
reader must excuse my adding it, long as this
note already is, from the beginning of the first book
of his Error-1⁵³ Granum. He is not wriffing, the
poet tells υε, to ‘⁶ court the world's applause 3”

No—tis to soothe
That agony of hem-t, which they, alone,
Who best have lov’d, who best have been belm‘df
Can feel, or pity ; sympathy severe !
Which she too felt, when, on hex· pallid lip,
The last farewel hung trembling, and bespoke
A wish to linger here, and bless the arms
She left, for heaven. She died, and heaven is
hers !
Be mine the pensive, solitary balm
That recollection yiclds.
While Mem’ry holds her seat, thine image still

Yes, angel pure!

Shall reign, shall triumph there3 and when, as now,
Imagination forms 3 nymph divine

To lead the fluent train, thy modest blush,

Thy mild demeanour, thy unpractis’d smile,
Shall grace that nymph, and sweet Simplicity

Be diest, (ah, meek Maria !) in thy charnis.

Ver. 93 9. ‘¹ Nor time dcstroy th' ctcr11algriffzvefi·e·l.]

Thus Virgil, and iu almost the same words:

Nulla dies unquam memori vos eximet aevo.
AEN. ix. 447.

No time your mem'ry ever shall destroy-
