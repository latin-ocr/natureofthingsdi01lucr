BOOK 1. THE NATURE oF THINGS. 79

Such feeble reas'ner5‚ in opposing vom,

A double vom confess: for, first, perforce,

A void they own, where void was none before,

Betwixt the substance sever’d3 and bring next 445

A proof surmouutlcss that the air itself

Throng'd with a prior void: else how, to bounds

Of closer texture, could it e'er eontract?

A thousand face . d round me: to the same

Converging all. But ιιι-Γ yle these, I ween, 4 50

Though but the footsteps 1:2³ 2-he mighty whole,

To fix thy saith, and guide thoe to the rest.

For as the bound, when once the tainted dew

His nostrils taste‚ pursues the vagrant fox

O’er hills, and daleS‚ and drags him from his lair3 4 5 5

So may’st thou trace from fact associate fact,

Through ev’ry maze, through ev'ry doubtful shade,

Till Truth’s bright form, at length, thy labours crown.

Nor tardy be the tofi, for much remains.

Or trac'd the mazy lev'ret o’er the lawn.—

Him no fell savage on the plain withstood,

None 'scap’d him bosom’d in the gloomy
wood ;

His eye how piercing, and his scent how true,
To wind the vapour in the tainted dew.

We recognise our own poet, however, in the fol-

lowing of his antagonist.

Ut canis occultam sylvis deprendere damam
Nare sagax, et odore sequi vestigia praedae
Venari docuit. Anu-Luca. vi. 50.

Thus learn we from the hound to hunt, of nose
Keen to pursue through tangled woods the deer,
Skulking from sight, and track his tainted steps,
