inhabit. Suns, and whole planetary systems‚ have
already disappeared from their stations in the hori-
zon, dissolved, perhaps, to primitive non-entity, or
resorbed in the material and central mass of universal
nature, from which they were at first projected, and
new creations' have been discovered in their stead.
What is there then, in the system of the earth
itself, to enable it to resist the common fate ?
Upon every analogy of reasoning, it also must event-

riod of its existence; but without such increase,
either of toil or ingenuity, its growing defects would
become daily more conspicuous. In what manner
this existence is finally to terminate, is of little con-
sequence3 most probably, by the operation of fue,
and long anterior to the period of the earth’s total
incapacity of production from any other cause. And
such, indeed, is the opinion advanced by our poet
himself in his fifth book. The elemental fire con-
tained in its own central bowels, whether electric or
culinary, is conceived, upon every geologic system,
to be immense. Many philosophers of the first repu-
tation in our own age, have calculated, that the great
body of the earth derives, at least ten times as much
heat from the extrication of these elemental and cen-
tral lires, as it does from the operation of the sun.
And the ravages the whole globe is sustaining from
earthquakes and volcanoes, the sure and dreadful ef-
fects of such latent and most powerful causes opera-
ting upon confined gasse5‚ and vast beds of com-
bustible materials, are, in every respect, deeper and
wider than those produced by any other cause. It is
no improbable conjecture then to suppose, even prior
to its total incapacity of production from mere
age, that the immediate dissolutior] of the earth
may be effected by the explosion of some immense
and central volcano oper-ating over every portion of
the globc at the same moment, and perhaps recon-
verting it into the same species of comet which Buf-
fon supposed it originally constituted. See note on

Book Ι. 646.—It was from an explosion of this sort,
occurring in the central and opake mass of universal
nature, that Dr. Herschell conceives the earth origi-
nally, and indeed all the existent systems of the uni-
verse, were emitted. See note on Book I. 1112.
And this idea of the dissolution of the earth, by a
general conflagration, is corroborated by the express
prophecies of the Scriptures‚ which inform us
(2 Pet. cap. iii. v. 10—12.), that “the heavens shall
be dissolved with fire, and shall pass away with a
great noise ι that the elements shall melt with fervent
heat, and the earth also, and the works that are there-
in, shall be burnt up.'’ See note on Book V. ver.
425.

It may, perhap3, be observed‚ in reply to the idea
of this gradual decay and final dissolution of the
earth, that although all compound material bodies do
suffer such gradual decay, and are continually chang-
ing, yet that the essentia} atoms of matter cannot be
conceived to suffer any change ; a fact, indeed,
contended for by Epicureans themselves: and that
as, according to another of their principleS, the de-
struction of one substance is but the generation of a
second, the great body ofthe earth itself must, at all
times, have the same quantity, and the same unvaried
quality of material atoms as the means of recruiting
its different forms and phaenomena ; in consequence of
which, that we have no reason to conceive that the
great body of the earth either gradually is decaying, or
ever can experience such a change as may produce its
total dissolution; and that Epicurus reasoned incon-
clusively upon his own principles when he formed

,such an idea-But Epicurus reasoned from the

living fact itself‚ a foundation upon which all
philosophy should be built, as far as the fact was
capable of applying‚ and from a close and obvious
analogy where the fact ceased. Whoever examines
nature must allow, that there is a sufficient quantity
of elemental atoms to recruit the individual system of
every animal and vegetable, as well as the general
orb of earth itself: but the individual systems of aui-
mals and vegetables are not recruited for ever. New
