tation upon the subject. I have at present, however, a motive for re-
printing this edition, of which, Ι could not, at first, be aware; for al-
most all its copies were unfortunately consumed by the fire that, about
two years ago, destroyed Mr. Hamilton's Printing-offices. To this
edition, nevertheless‚ I have not, in every instance, adhered in my
translation3 on some few occasions preferring the lection of prior ex-

readily availed myself of such assistance: but in all other instances,
as also where the version in common use is not sufficiently close
to the original author to answer the purpose of the quotation, I
have taken the liberty of giving a version myself. This, as will be
