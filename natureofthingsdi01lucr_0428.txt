DE RERUM NATURA.

L1n. ΙΙ.

Sernota a nostris rebus, sejunctaque, longe.

Nam, privata dolore omni, privata periclis,

Ipsa suis pollens opibus, nihil indiga nostri,

Nec bene promeritis capitur, neque tangitur ira.

650

Terra quidem vero caret omni tempore sensu ;

Sed, quia multarum potitur primordia rerum,

Multa, modis multis, ecfert in lumina solis.

Heio, si quis mare Neptunum, Cereremque vocare

T h’ empyreal waste, where happy spirits hold ,

Beyond this concave heaven, their calm abode.
Plus. or IMAG. Ι, 202.

The disembodied spirits of good and vii-tuous men,
are represented in the same glorious system, as
associating with them, and partaking of their felicity.
No idea ean be more consoling to those who are left
behind ς and it forms, as it ought to do, the common
theme of our monumental apostrophes. Camoens
thus begins a beautiful sonnet upon the death of his
friend, Donna Catalina de Ataside.

Alma minha gentil, que te partiste
Ta} cedo desta vida descontente,
Responsa la* no ceo eternamemaec,

E viva en ca na terra sempre triste.

Go, gentle spirit ! now supremely blest,

From soenes of pain and strnggling virtue go Ε

From thy immortal seat qs heavenly rest

Eehold us liug‘ring iu a world of woe!
Harum.

Ver. 663. Vice no revengc, and virtue draws no
brom] Happffless, according to Epicurus,

was totally inconsistent with a subjection to human
passions of every kind. The tranquil beatitude of
superior beings could never, therefore, be disturbed
either by suffering virtue, or triumphant vice. Upon
this subject we have his own words, as recorded by

Diogenes Laertius, x. 139 t To μακαριον, και αΦΘαρτον,
ΟΗΤΕ αυῒῖ πραὙμ-ατα ‘XM' ov‘rff &2271 ffoepfxfl· ὥστε 011⁷! ΟΡ·
γαις, ουτε xmp-en, συνεχεται : which passage Cicero has
thus rendered ε Quod beatum aeternumque sit, id nec
habere ipsum negotii quidquam, nec exhibere alteri ς
itaque neque ira. neque gratia, teneri. De Nat.
Deor. i. 17. “ That which is blessed and immor-
tal can never be disturbed with concerns either of
ite own or of other being-53 nor can it be affected
either with love or hatred.’'

Mr. Cowper, following the general, but erroneous
opinion entertained concerning the tenets of this
school of philosophy, is hence rather too severe upon
it in the following verses:

Yet thus we doat, refusing, while we can,
Instruction‚ and inventing to onrselves

Gods, such as guilt makes welcome‚ gods that sleep
Or disregard our fomes, or that sit

Amus’d spectators ostht’s bustling world.

ΤΑεκ, Book V.
Annaeus Seneca has imitated this verse of our poet

most obviously, iu the following address to For-
tune :

Sed cur idem
Qi tanta regis, sub quo vasti
Pondera mundi librata suos

 

Ducunt orbe53 hominum nimium
