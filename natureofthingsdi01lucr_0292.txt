Verum semina multimodis inmixta latere

Multarum rerum in rebus communia debent.

nomenon, of the tops of soi-ests suddenly taking fire
from the violent collision of branch against branch,
has been adverted to by Thucydides, and many later
historians. They are still frequent in the immense
forests of Finland, and are noticed‚ but'differently
accounted for, by M. Acerbi‚ in his Journey from
Yervendale to Wasa. “ Partial fires,” says he, “ con-
flagrations and tempests had committed frightful ra-
vages in the bosom of this forest, which presented
us, here and there, with exhibitions highly surpris-
ing and impressive. Every body has heard of the con·
flagrations so frequent in Sweden, and in the coun-
tries of the North iu general. Entirc mountains,
and tracts of several miles, covered with woods, vare
liable to be devoured by flames. Much has been
said, and written, in order to explain the origin of

those fires. Some have attributed them to the rays
of the sun, which continue so long above the hori-
son 3-*but this is fabulous, and unworthy of notice.‘’
He then, generally, ascribes them to two common
causes: the peasants smoking their pipes as they
travel through the woods, together with their cook-
ing· their food as they proceed3 and a right granted
to them by their political constitution, of cutting
down and carrying away from the crown lands all
trees and fragments of trees that have been injured

by fires: to obtain which privilege they often pur.
posely excite them. “ 1 saw,'’ continues he, “in this

forest, the disastrous wreck of oue of those confla-
grations which had devoured the wood through an
extent of six or seven miles, and which exhibited a
most dismal spectacle. You not only saw trunks
and large remains of trees lying iu confusion on the
