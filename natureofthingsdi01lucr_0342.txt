the most closely-vitrified flint may assume an a'e'rial
form ; and that iron has been found, not only in the
blood of animals, but in the juices of plants which
have been purposely guarded from the access of all
bodies of which this metal has been supposed to con-
stitute a component part. The elementaiy particles
of all bodies being thus capable of extreme division
aud volatilization, M. Hombolt has conceived that
atmospheric stones, which fall to the earth, have
been previously volatilized by the medium of hy-
drogenous gass, which, inflaming in the upper re-
gions ofthe atmosphere, re-unites their primary cor-
puscles, that till then existed in a state of mutual re-
pulsion. The opinion which contends, that the ele-
ments of these masses are a simple aggregate of the
volatilized debris of substances emitted from the
earth, united by mere affinity of composition; that
of M. Patrin, who conceives that the substances
which seed volcanos and meteoric stones are of the
same description, and are furnished by the fluids of
the atmosphere which circulate through the upper
strata of the globe, and are there variously modified
and combined3 that of M. Izarn, who conjectures,
as I have already observed, that all gasses them-
selves are componuds, and that all the most solid
substances in nature are mere combinations of the
elementary matter of gasses, whence solid sub-
stances may as readily be gendered in the air as
beneath the earth: these theories all point to the
hypothesis of Epicurus as their common basis, so
far, I mean, as relates to the existence and diffusion
of elementary atoms through every point of nature,
through the earth, the atmosphere‚ and even the
immensity of space. Those who, reasoning from
M. La Place’s calculation, respecting the projectile
force necessary to throw bodies from the moon to-
wards the earth, derive these substances from lunar
volcanos, approximate the Epicurean tenet, how-
ever, in a greater degree still; for such not only
admit the existence of the same material corpuscles
through different planets‚ but a power of actual
combination into the same aggregate substances

throughout every orb in the universe: while M.

Chladni‚ who conjectures that these bodies are
formed from substances exterior to the atmo-
sphere of the earth and other planets, substances
which have never incorporated with them, and
are consequently found loose in the vast ocean
of space, seems to embrace this part of the Epi-
curean theory in its utmost latitude. But it
is time to attend to the mode by which, ac-
cording to Epicurus, these elementary atoma are
united and combined. According to Democritus,
and the earlier atomic philosophers‚ the motions of
primary corpuscles were only produced by solidity‚
weight, or re-action. Every atom was supposed to
be intrinsically ponderous, and of course to be con-
stantly descending‚ and that in a direction perfectly
rectilinear. As some atoms, however, were con-
ceived to be larger‚ and consequently more pon·
derous than others, it was imagined, that some must
move with more velocity than others—that the hea-
vier must overtake the lighter—that they must
impinge against each other with considerable force—-
and that a new species of motion would be hereby
engendered,—-a motion by re-action, as the former
was a motion by mere weight. These laws being
either essential, or eternally imposed, every thing,
it was contended, must arise regularly and neces-
sarily: for the degree of resilition, produced by the
impulse of atom against atom, is a result as cer-
tain, and, allowing for the effect of magnitude, and
consequent velocity, as calculable, as the measure
of distance produced by weight alone. Order,
therefore, it was asserted, must be the unavoidable
issue of such a combination of facts: and definite
results must, in every individual instance, follow,
with the certainty of fate, froni definite causes.

But, by various experiments‚ which Epicurus had
been fortunate enough to make, it appeared, that
although, in dense medium, bodies of greater so-
lidity‚ aud consequently containing a larger quan-
tity of matter, descended with more velocity than
lighter aud less solid bodies, yet, where no medium
at all existed, and they were surrounded by apure
vacuum, as it was conceived, in space they must.
