And crowds of gazers weeping as they view’d.

Dumb with alarm, with supplicating knee,

And lifted eye, she sought compassion still;

Fruitless and unavailingz vain her youth,

Her innocence, and beauty3 Vainthe boast

Of regal birth3 and vain that first herself
Lisp'd the dear name of F ather, eldest born.

Forc'd stom her suppliant posture, straight she view’d

The altar full prepar'd: not there to blend

Connubial vows, and light the bridal torch3

But, at the moment when mature in charms‚
While Hymen call'd aloud, to fall, e'en then,
A father’s vietim‚ and the price to pay

Of GRECIAN navieS, favoured thus with gales.——

Such are the crimes that SUPERSTITroN prompts!

Klopstock, however, has been far more sensible of

the beauty and pathos of this admirable picture ; and,
with no small felicity, has transplanted it into the
second book of the Messias. It occurs in the soli-
tary meditation of the repentant Abbadona, when he
had first desei-ted his infernal companions. It is thus

Ohne zu zittern, ihn schopfer zu nennen, wie gerne

But call Creator, freely would 1 now
Yield the dear name ofsather, name belov’d,

And still pronounc’d by those who ne’er trans-
gress'd.

before observed, employed the term religion, instead
of superstition, to interpret the religio of Lucretius.

mon example, in the note on verse 63 of this book.
The cardinal Polignac, following the general, but
erroneous interpretation, has deemed it necessary, in
his Anti-Lucretius, to inform us that the poet whom
he opposes was mistaken z that this, and other
equally barbarous transacfions, were not the effect of
religion, but of impiety ; as though impiety were not
the very subject he meaned to object against,—ealled,
indeed, but falsely, religion, by the general mass of
his contemporaries. The following is the cardinal’e
allusion to the episode before us:

Effera tantum igitur potuit suadere malorum
Impietas, non Religio ς qnae prava coercens
