lxii THE LIFE OF LUCRETIUS.

himself. The tale runs that Epicurus, both in the porticos, and pub-
lic walks of Athens, at one time indulges himself with Leontius, at
another time with Themista : that he wears out the day in sleep, and
the night in gainbling‚ drunkenness, or public riots: that he is now
guilty of some crime, and now of some impicty : but that, at all times,
he is sottish, and unworthy of attention.

“ To these calumnies Epicurus made no reply. He regarded them
as belonging to the class of ephemeral rumours that die away of their
own accord as soon as they are found incompetent to their end.
The consciousness of his own innocence was sufficient for himself; and
the fortitude andtranquillity he discovered in the midst of such insa-
mous aspersions are stronger proofs of the integrity of his life than
the testimony ofa thousand witnesses. To despisc the evil reports that
are raised against us, and to confide in the just judgment of unbiasscd
postmity, is to be revenged upon our enemies in the most splendid
manner possible. As to Diotiinus, therefore, Epicurus neither hated,
nor was incensed against him: buthe pitied, and was sorry for him.
I-Ie left him quietly, however, to that fate, which was certainly well
deserved, but unexpected on his own pa1·t; for the writings of this ca-
lumniator were so full of ribaldry, and mere attempts at wit, that
Aristophanes, with all his comic powers, could never have excited

half so much of the public laughter against any one, as Diotimus at
last excited against liiniself*.''

Those, who wish to see a further account of these unjust and iniqui-
tous reports‚ may consult Gassendi's Life of this celebrated philoso-

* Rondellius de Vit. et Mor. Epicuri, p. 15. The infamous letters which Diotimus endeavoured to
circulate as the writings of Epicurus, and on which he founded his defamations‚ were proved, in a public
court, to be forgeries of his own, and the author was punished accordingly. Laert. x. 3. Athen. xiii-

the fact that his most prying and inveterate adversaries could only attack him by forgeries and fraudulent
impositions.
