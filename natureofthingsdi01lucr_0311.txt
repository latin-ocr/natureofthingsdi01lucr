THE NATURE OF 'rHiNGs

163

Through boundless vacuum the drear mass of things

Would quick be borne z or, rather, nought had ris'n

From the crude cham, joyless, and inert.

For never, doubtless‚ from result of thought,

Or mutual compact, could primordial seeds

Or mutual compact‚ could primordial seeds
First harmonize, or move with powers precise.

Who is there, indeed, in the present day, that
can suppose they could thus harmonize? And yet,
strange to relate! this very passage, including se-
veral of the verses that follow, has been adduce-d
against Lucretius, as a proof of unpardonable impiety z
and Lactantius has chosen to assert, that “he has
hereby reached the utmost point of insanity, and
could not possibly go beyond.”
he, numerum perfectae insaniae, ut nihil ulterius ad-

Implevit, says

jici possit. De Ira. Such are the unmerited scan-
dals to which our much injured and highly deserving
bard has for ages been condemned! Having exposed
these opinions of his mistaken antagonists, he adven-
tures to give us his own :—-and what is it?

But ever changing, ever chang'd, and vext,
From earliest time, through ever-during space,
With ceaseless repercussion, every mode

Of motion, magnitude, and shape essay’d ;
At length th' unwieldy mass the form assum’d
Of things created.

The Mosaic cosmogony itself cannot be more con-
sistent with the existence of a Supreme First cause.
It supposes a chaos3 and it supposes the gradual de-
rivation of all things from this chaos⁵ put into mo-
tion, and necessarily labouring, without any intelli-
gente qfits own, for the gradual evolution of all
things. On the actual existence of this chaos upon
the system of our elaborate poet, see B. vi. of this
work, where the whole series of the production of
the world is most minutely, and elegantly discussed.
But there is no mention here made ofanyintelligcnt and
extritis-{c Being, whom we can conceive as the Eternal
first Cause of this motion: true, there is no such
mirmion made, nor do I know that there is any such

uecessity; it is the physieal effect alone we are coir
templating‚ and upon the proofs and principles Ι,
have advanced in the prefixed Life of Lucretius,
such an intelligent Being is doubtless irnplied‚ though
he be not immediately adverted to in the passage
before us. And with such an implication nothing
can be more consistent, more rational, or more pious.
Even Des Cartes himself, upon this principle, has
rescued, as far as h: was able, the character of Epi-
curus, from every charge of impiety and irration-
ality. See note on v. 168 of this Book. Of all our
modern geologists‚ Mr. Kirwan has taken most pains
to reconcile the theory of Moses with modern dis-
coveries and experiments ; or rather, to demonstrate
that it is the only true system of geology that a phi-
losopher can, or ought to admit. But Mr. Kirwan
himself is under the necessity of conceiving, that
many ages elapsed, after the first existence of the
earth in a state of cham, before it was fit for the
habitation of animals and vegetables, and that the
great work of creation was gradually advancing du-
ring the whole of this period of timc3 in conse-
quence of which, he supposes also, that the days of the
Hebrcw historian are not to be understood literally‚
but more comprehensively, and that they compn'se
so many distinct eras of the events that occurred.
The system of geology at present most fashionable
in France is that of La Metherie: but La Metherie
also supposes the same fact as to the period of cre-
ation‚ and its division into distinct epochs3 as he
does also, that the world was originally submersed in
a primitive ocean, forming hereby an universal and
liquid chaos. Many of the positious of La Me-
therie are opposed by the fanciful Rern-and, in his
Nouveaux Principes de Geologie ; but even Bertrand
himself adheres to this doctrine of the progressive cre-
ation or evolution of the carth, as it exists at present.
