DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. 1.

Quae quoniam rerum naturam sola gubernas,

Nec sine te quidquam dias in luminis oras

Exoritur, neque fit laetum neque amabile quidquam;

Te sociam studeo scribundis versibus esse,

QUOS ego de RERUM NATURA pangere COHOI‘

Memmiadae nostr03 quem tu, Dea, tempore in omni

Omnibus ornatum voluisti excellere rebus:

Quo magis aeternum da dictis,

Ecfice, ut interea fera moenera militiai,

Diva, leporem.

30

Par maria ac terras omneis, sopita, quiescant.

Nam tu sola potes tranquilla pace juvare

Mortaleis: quoniam belli fera moenera Mavors

Love flies—and earth his mighty influence shares ;
From the bold bird th' electrie flash that dares,
Deep to the monsters that in ocean dwell,

All feelhis force, and with his fury swell.

O'er the rich glebe he fires the courser’s blood,
Bathes him in foam, and plunges in the flood ;
Stung with desire he snorts th’ a'e'rial tide,

And o’er the Thracian hius demands his bride.
Her breath scarce scented, barriers all are vain,
Cliffs, forests, cataracts, no more restrain ι

He flies, he finds, he triumphs, and, opprest‚
With eyes still sparkling, yields his limbs to rest.

Ver. 27. To Mmmus’ vie-w——] Caius Mem-
mius Gemellus, a fellow-student of Lucretius at
Athens. The family of the Memmii were of high
antiquity, and of very deserved renown among the
Romans. Virgil thought proper to pay them a com-
pliment by representing them as descendants from
Mnestheus, who commanded one of the four ships that
opened the naval games he has described in his AEneid.

Velocem Mnestheus agit acri remige Pristin,
Mox Italus Mnestheus, genus a quo nomine Memmi.

Mnestheus commands the Pristis, swift of oar,
Italian Mnestheus, whence the Memmii spring.

The Memmius whose patronage Lucretius here
bespeaks, arrived at different and distinguished dig-
nities in the Roman republic. During his praetorship
he obtained the government of the province of Bithy-
nia, and was afterwards appointed one of the tribunes
of the people3 an office his uncle had held with the
highest reputation to himself, and benefit to the re-
public. It was this elder Memmius who first excited
the Roman citizens to investigate the infamous con-
duct of Jugurtha‚ and accused the senate of venality
and corruption. He procured an order for the for-
mer to be summoned to the forum, from the very
center of the kingdom of Numidia3 and boldly re-
primanded him, when he appeared before the people,
for his iniquitous conduct. But the city that, a few
years afterwards, banished the virtuous Metellus, was
already unworthy of the patriotic and undaunted spirit
ofCaiusMemmius. He fell a sacrifice to the lawless vio-
lence of Apuleius anerlaueiffi during the comitia for
the election of consuls, to which office these ambitious
desperadoes were fearful he would have been chosen.
