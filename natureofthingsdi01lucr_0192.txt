DE RERUM NATURA.

LtB. I.

Quippe ita formido mortaleis continet omneiS,

Quod multa in terris fieri coeloque tuentur,

Quorum operum caussas nulla ratione videre

“ That nothing has been produced from non-ex-
“ istence, and to non-existence can never degenerate.”
It forms the key-stone of the philosophy in the poem
before us; and is, therefore, constantly reverted to
by Lucretius. By power divine we must understand,
if we understand any thing at all, either the divinity
of the world itse1f‚-in which case he directs his
dogma against the Platonists and Pythagoream, or
else the divinity of the popular gods,—and then he is
opposing the multitude: since the idea of an eternal
intelligent being, at whose mere will and command
all Nature sprung into, and is still supported in,
her present system of beauty, harmony, and order,
constituted, as I have observed in the prefixed
life of Lucretius, an avowed article of the Epi-
curean creed; while various passages of the poem
before us, and‘ particularly in the fifth book, prove
obviously that Lucretius no more rejected this⁴dogma
of Epicurism than he did any other. The real doc-
trine of Epicurus, upon this subject, appears to be
as follows : In common with the philosophers of every
school, he believed in the eternity of matter ; for they
all equally conceived it an absurdity to suppose that
the Deity himself could create any thing outv of no-
thing: but that though matter existed from all eter-
nity, there was a time when it was first endowed by
the intelligent eternal Cause with powers of motion,
and a consequent capability of organization and order.
From this moment} motion commenced ; atoms be-
gan to unite with atoms ; concrete substances to be
produced ; affinities to multiply ; and the univcrse to
assume form τ’ but an incalculable number of ap-
parently different motions were essayed, and of years
exhausted‚ before that form was finally completed.
This theory of cosmogony is detailed most beauti—
fully, and at full length, by Lucretius, in his fifth

tions of Epicurus, that the world entirely proceeded
from the will and command of him who possesses all
immortality‚ and all beatitude. It completely re-
moves the impiety with which this doctrine of ap-
parent chance has been perpetually loaded. It
formed, for the most part, the actual opinion of
Dinant‚ Abelard‚ and other christian Epicureans,
but more especially of ¹Gassendi3 and very closely
corresponds with the system of Des Cartes, which is
founded entirely upon such asuppositiom “ There
‘⁴ is nothing‚'’ says he, “ contradictory to the ra-
“ tional faculties of man, in conceiving that the Deity
“ did no more than create the original chaos ofall
“ things3 enduing it with certain laws, and leaving
‘⁴ it to the gradual operation of those laws—to pro-⁷
“ duce order from confusion, to separate element
“ from clement, and form the vast varieties of animals
‘⁴ and vegetables that exist over the whole earth, and

matter alone, is the avowed doctrine of La Metherie,
De Luc, Hutton, Whitehurst‚ Kirwam and almost
all our modern cosmologists. Nor could it be other-
wise, than upon such an interpretation, that several
learned poets of Italy have attempted to reconcile the
principles of Epicurus, or Democritus, with those of
the Christian religion ; and, among others, Gio.
Michele Milani‚ who, iu 1698, printed, as we are
told by Crescembiui‚ a very long and learned canzone
on light, extendig to net less than eighty-three
stanzas; much oi which uas devoted to this very
subject. “ In essa,'' says he, “ si spiega buona parte
