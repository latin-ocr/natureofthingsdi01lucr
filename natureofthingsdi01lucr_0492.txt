DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. ΙΙ.

Quis regere inmensi summam, quis habere profundi

Indu manu validas potis est moderanter habenas ?

Ver. 1 10 5. For Ο, γε powers divine ! whose tranquil

lives
F low free from care, with ceaseless sun-shine
blest‚--] There is, in Mr⁴ Cowper’sTask,
an observation upon the doctrine here vulgarly supposed
to be advanced‚ so well though at the same time so
severely expressed, that I cannot avoid inserting it in
this place :
Some say that in the origin of things,
When all creation started into birth,
The infant elements receiv’d a law
From which they swerve not since. That under
force
Of that controlling ordinance they move,
And need not his immediate hand, who first
Prescrib'd their course, to regulate it now.
Thus dream they ; and contrive to save a God
Th' incumbrance qs his own concerns, and spare
The great artificer of all that moves
The stress of a continual act, the pain
Ofunremitted vigilance and care
As too laborious and severe a task ἔ
Boox vi.

Ver. 1107. Who the vast whole could guide, midst
all your ranks ,9

tho grarp the reins that curb th’ Εκτιιιε

or *ri-imos ?] There is a grandeur and

sublimity in this passage which it is perhaps impossi-

ble to surpass. Yet it cannot but remind us of some

parts of the fearful and magnificent reply of the
Almighty to Job out of the whirlwiud.

The following may suffice as an example:

Cum. xxxviii.
4 Say, where wast thou when first the world uprose
Fresh from its God Ξ thy wisdom doubtlest
knows ἒ
5 Who plann'd its bulk, its limits‚ its design ἓ
Stretch'd o’er its breadths the plummet and the
fine?
6 What forms its basis? props its nether pole?
Who rear’d the top-stone o’er the mighty whole,
7 When, at the sight, the stars of morning sang,
And heaven’s high eope with shouts of rapturo:
rang ?—
1 2 With thee coeval, is the dawn thy slave?
springs, at thy nod, young phosphore from the
wave ?
16 Hast thou the deep pervaded or descried
The dread abyss whence ocean draws his tide ?

Cap. xl.
