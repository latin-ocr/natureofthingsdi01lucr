ΒοοΚ III. THE' NATURE OF 'fumos 419

And mystic vapour, and the power unnam'd 280
That rears th' incipient stimulus, and first

Darts sentient motion through ·the quiv’ring frame.
Far from all vision this profoundly lurks,
Through the whole system's utmost depth diffus'd‚
And lives as soul of e'en the soul itself. 285
As with each limb the general spirit blends,
Though ne'er discern'd, so subtle and so few
Its primal seeds—-so, through the spirit, spreads
This form ineffable, this mystic power,

Soul of the soul, and lord of mortal man. 290
Thus, too, commixt must vapour‚ hear, and air,

Live through each limb united3 and, though oft

Each rise o’er each triumphant, still uprear

and lord of lords.'' In like manner, Pope has ren--
dered the phrase, Sam καρτισπος awanam, “ god of
gods.''

Ac simplex 2 ideo non constat partibus ullis.-
Quae pars imperio sic nata videbitur una ?
Qae pars reginae tandem regina futura est ?

 

rma-e? mnf? εἷσον ειμι θεων καρτιστος aravum

Ιι. viii. 16.

Let him, who tempts me, dread those dire abodw,
And know th' Almighty is the god ofgmls.

Marchetti has well translated this passage of ont*

poet τ
sta nel corpo ascesa
Alma di tutta l’ alma, e signoreggia
In tutto il corpo.

Pelignac has imitated it ς but, as 1 have before ob-
ser-ved, he did not understand the physiology of the in the fo

Epicurean soul z

Nam res perpetitur quae tot simul anxia motus,

Res ea quae timet atque cupit, gaudetque. doletque,

Qae sentit, varios et sensus comparat, nna est

Qae pars mentis erit vere mens ?

Auri-Luc. Lib. V. v. 874.
For what, thus anxious, can such moveruent·
bear,

Can hope and fear, can sorrow and rejoice,

Can feel and judge of feeling& must be one ς
One in itself, nor can of parts consist.—

Thus, one by birth, what part shall rule the rest ?
Parts of one lord‚ what part be lord itself?
What part of mind to real mind pretend ?

But Lucretius Is no where better illustrated than
llowing passage of the well-known speech of

Hamlet to his friend Horatio:

Give me that man
That is not Passion’s slave, and 1 will wear him
In my heart’s core ; ay, in my beart qfhmrt.
