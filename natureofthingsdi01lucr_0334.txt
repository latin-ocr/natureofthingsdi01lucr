DE RERUM NATURA.

L1 Β. 11.

Delicias quoque utei multas substernere possint ;

Gratius interdum neque Natura ipsa requirit τ

A similar remark recurs in many other parts of the
present poem, but particularly in b. v. v. 1 139.

Yet truest riches—would mankind their breasts

Bend to the study‚ in a little lie,

With mind well pois'd: here want can never
come.

The idea is indeed common to moralists in every
age and nation. Thus Horace :

Jure perhorrui
Late conspicuum tollere verticem—
Bene est, cui Deus obtulit

 

Parca, quod satis est, manu.

Well have Ι shunn’d to rear my brows
Mid soenes of pomp and care:

For happiest he whom God allows
Enough, though nought to spare-

So the Hebrew sage, Prov. xxx. 8.

’ξ’ w · ns& witi mm

Give me neither poverty nor rie-hes 3
Feed me with food convenien for me.

Ver. 23r What, though the dome be waning, whose
proml rii-alls] The description is as true to
historic fact, as it is exquisite in poetic embellish-
ment. The Roman Patricians, in the magnificence
os their palaces, were at this time exhibiting all the
splendour of the East. Their vaulted ceilings, and
i.i many cases, the whole interior of their walls, were
nither overlaid with gold or ivory, or inl-aid with a
mosaic of both. Even the outermost courts or
vestibules in Cleopatra's palme, as we learn from
Lucan, were lined with the latter, Phars. x. ¹¹93
while Nero, as Suetonius informs us. (in Nerone,
r. 3¹) preferer the former, and overlaid his palace
wir'n sirecegold alone. It is to the mosaic, or al-
ternate inlay of the two, that Horace refers, in the
tollaming vt rsesz
Nun einr, neque ‚aureum

Ele-j. render in domo [armar. ἦ. 18.

Nor ivory, nor golden dome
Blazes around my humble home.

The palace of Menelaus is represented by Homer
as having been more curiously tesselated still, and
having been equally irradiated,

Χρυσου τ’, ηλεκτρου τε, και αργυρου, η Σ ελεφωντος.

On. Δ. 7²·
With amber, silver, ivory, and gold.

To these the luxurious Orientalists added sap-
phires, beryls, and other preeious stones, of which
the sapphire appears to have been most in favour3
and was intended, in the swelling vault of the eciling,
to imitate, by the introduction of silver stam, the ap-
pearance of the heavens at midnight. The Hebrews
were accustomed to this magnificent architecture; and
the superb and splendid descriptions of the throne of
the Almighty‚ in Ezekiel and the Apocalypse‚ obvi-
ously allude to it. In like manner we are told, Exod.
xxiv. 10, that when God visibly manifested himself
to Moses and the elders of Israel, ‘⁴ they saw, as it
were, undei- his feet a paved (or tessalated) work of
sapphire stone5‚ and the clear azure vault of the
heavens.‘'

Thus, the Persian poet Sadi, in his book of
apophthegms, describing the sky itself:
