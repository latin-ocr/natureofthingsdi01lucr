lxxxiv THE LIFE OF LUCRETIUS.

derived from no common foundation, nor possessed of any uniformity
of conception. Generally speaking, nloreover, the tenet itself was
destroyed by the mode in which it was explained. What was the nature
of the soul, in the opinion of those who contended for its incorruptibi-
luy? An emanation froin the divine and universal mind ⁵¹³—a particle
of the divine aul·a†‚ an idea ἶ, an acon ξ. How was it ‹lisposed of, up-
on its separation from the body? It transmigrated into some other
body3 it remigrated to the soul of the world Π ; it was resorbed by the
divine universal Mind. But in either case, the soul is possessed of no
separate θητίῳ, and as much ceascs to exist per se, or to be what it was
before, as if it perished with the body, and returned to the common
mass of the material world. RVG cannot wonder, therefore, that, even
among the Stoics and Platonists‚ the doctrine of a post-existence of
the soul appeared to be frequently doubtful and undecided. They
believed, and they disbelieved ; they hoped‚ and they feared ; and life
passed away in a state of perpetual anxiety and agitation. But this
was not all: perplext, cvcn when they admitted the doctrine, about
the will of the Deity, and the mode ofsecuring his favour after death,
with their own philosophie speculations they intermixed the religion
of the people. They acknowledged the existence of the popular divi-
nities; cloathed them with the attributes of the Eternal himself ; and,
anxious to obtain their benedicfion, were punctilious in attending at
their temples‚ and united in the sacrifices that were offered. Such
was the conduct of the most worthy and the most enlightened ; of So<
crates {I and of Plato *ἒξ of Cicero ’pi‘ and Seneca ζῖΐῑ.
