lvi THE LIFE OF LUCRETIUS.

Nor music echo round the gaudy roos?
Yet listless laid the velvet grass along,

Near gliding streams3 by shadowy trees o’er·arch'd,

Such pomps we need not ; such still less when SPRING

which Plutarch, Seneca, and even Cicero himself, after he had ab·
jured his primal saith, countenanced the libels by which the character
of Epicurus was unjustly defamed. Intimately acquainted with the
tranquil and temperate life of Lucretius, Cicero, at least, must have
