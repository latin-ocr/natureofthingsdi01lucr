DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. III.

Illud ab hoc igitur quaerundum est, quid sit amari

Tanto opere, ad somnum si res redit, atque quietem,

Quur quisquam aeterno possit tabescere luctu ?

Hocc’ etiam faciunt, ubi discubuere tenentque

925

Pocula saepe homines, et inumbrant ora coronis;

And thus Ercilla, probably with an eye equally
directed to the whole of this addrcss of our own
poet :

Qe y Ξι el dolor me ha puesto en tal estremo
Q{e mas la vida que la muerte temo.
Que no se mal que y a danai· me pueda
Ni ay bien mayor que no le aver tenido,
Accabese y fenezca lo que queda
Fuesque mi dolce amigo ha fenecido.

For, in such grief I draw my lingering breath,
Life is my dread beyond the pange of death:
There is no ill that now can wonnd my breast,
No εοξοοό, but what I in my love possest.
Hy then l ye hours, that keep me from the dead ;
For he, the spirit of my life, is fied.

Hnm.

Ver. 940. What then has Anah, selemith ἵνα* mere
repose,
And quiet οηζγ in a pearssnl grave,
What has it thus to mar this lise of man Ρ]
Ovid has thus imitated this passage with much spirit
and felicity ι

Stulte, quid cst somnus, gelidae nisi mortis imago ἓ
Longa quiescendi tempora fata dabunt.

Amor.. ii. 941.

Say, what is deep, thou smol! but Denth’s re-
pose ἒ

And long the time for elumber fate bestoxvs.

lt is impossible, in this place. not to be rcniindcd
of the very elegant <pigram of our late wm-:hy poct-
laurtat, Dr. T. Vl'anon, designed to have been
placed beneath a statue of Sleep, in the classic garden
of his friend ΜΓ. Harris, and for the id-ta of which

he was certainly iudebtcd to Lucretius:

Somne levis ! quanquam certissima mortis imago,
Consortem cupio te, tamen esse tori:

Alma quies, optata veni 3 nam, sie, sine vita
Vivere, qnam suave est ; sic sine morte, mori.

Dr. Walcot has well translated this; but the
translation loses somcwhat of the resemblance to Lu-
cretius, which is contained in the original :

Come, gentle Sleep‚ attend thy votary’s prayer,
And, though Death's image, to my conch rcpair !
How sweet, thus lifeleSS‚ yet with life to lie,
Thus, without dying, O how sweet to die!

These frequent imitanum, however, by poets in
later periods, are not in the least to be wondered at t
for, asit is justly observed by Mr. Wakefield, “the
lines in the present book, from ver. 858, to its con-
clusion, are to be ranked with the most noble mo-
numents of ancient letters; not, indeed, yielding to
any of the poetica} efforts of Greece herself; so po-
lis-hed are they, and smooth, so serious, magnificent
and pathetic‚ that nothing can possibly exceed them ;
and so deeply do they penetrate, as it were, to the
very marrow of the soul.'' Haud dubitaverim affir-
mare hos ducenos et quinquagenos fere versus, ad
hujusce libri tinem, esse vel nobilissimis antiquarum
literarum reliquiis annumerandos ; neque ipsius qui-
dem Graeciae poetas velim excipi: adeo sunt omnia
climata, numerosa‚1nagnilica, graviaaraonmoe, ut nihil
supra ; et usque ad medullam animae penetrantia.

Ver. 943. E'en o’er lhefisli-ve Imm-d, ι

crown'd,] Dryden has well paraphrased
the whole of this passage, as he has, iudet-d, all the

remaining verses of this book :
