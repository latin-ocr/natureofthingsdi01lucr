THE NATURE OF THINGS.

Shaking the solid glebe, while the bright pomp

Flames through the skies, and gilds the glowing earth,

While groans the ground beneath their mighty dead,

335

And hills, and heavens re-echo to their shouts—

View'd from afar, the splendid scene that spreads

Seems void of motion, to the fields affixt.

Come, now, my friend, and, next, perspicuous mark

What countless shapes primordial seeds assume,

340

How vast their variance: for, though myriads swarm

at least, a most admirable specimen of imitative har-
mony ε

Mas ja cos escadrbes da gente armada,
Os Eborenses campos vio qualhados
Lustra co sol arnes, a langa 3 a espada
Vam rinehando os cavallos jaezados ;
Α canora trombeta embandeirada

Os coracoes i paz acostumados :

Vay as fulgentes armos incitando
Pelias concavidades retumbando.

The glittering squadrons march in proud array 3
On burnish’d shields tbe trembhng sun-beams
play :
The blaze of arms the warlike rage inspires»,
And wakes, from slothful peace, the hero's
fires.
With trampling hoofs Evora’s plains rebound,
And sprightly neighings echo far around 3
Far on each side the clouds of dust arise,
The drum's rough rattling rolls along the skies ς
The trumpet's shrilly clangour sounds alarms,
And each beart burns, and ardent pants for arms.

The glittering pomp that is reflected from the arms

of the warriors, is not forgotten in the well-known
ballad of Chevy Chace ε

Wher syx and thirtte Skottish knyghtes
On a day wear beaten down ;

Glen—dale glyttcryde with ther armor bryghte
Over castill‚ towar, and town.

But, above all, ought 'we to bear in mind that sub·
lime description of Milton, in his Paradise Lost:

He spake, and, to confirm his words, outflew
B. i. 663.

Millions offlaming swords, &c.

consequent weight of atoms, together with their dif-
ferent modes of motion, onr philosophie poet now
proceeds to develope another of their propertics; to
wit, their variation of size and figure. This, though
not a subject of ocular demonstration, he endeavours
to establish by a variety of forcible arguments and
analogies. Epicurus, in a variety of passages, but
more especially in his epistle to Herodotus, had long
before advanced the same doctrine : Τοι oca-0542 τω vow-
