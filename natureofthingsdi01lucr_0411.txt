Boon II. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 263

Facts without which Creation’s self would fail,

As all must thus proceed, augment, mature.

And hence the primal seeds of all that live

Must‚ too, be bounffless, whence each want is fed.
Nor can the mortal motions that wear out 575
The varied forms of things, with utter doom,
Prevail for ever: nor e'en those, revers'd,
Of genial pow’r‚ that quicken into life,
Can, through perpetual time, that life sustain.
Thus war eternal, midst the seeds of things, 580

With equal triumph reigns 3 now here, now there,

The vital pow’rs o’ercoming, and o’ercome.

The sigh funereal mingles with the bleat

Of babes just bursting to the light of heaven3

Nor night o'er day, nor morn o’er night prevails, 585
ΑΒΜ marks the discord—INFANcY's shrill cry

Mixt with sick mouns, th’ apparitors of DEATH.

This too, attentive, treasure in thy mind τ
That nought the sight surveys, the soul conceives‚

Flows from one class of prima] seeds alone. 590

Whate'er exists is compound 3 and the more

The latent powers, the energies it boasts‚
The more complex its nature 3 rear'd to life

From seeds more variouS‚ and of various shape.
