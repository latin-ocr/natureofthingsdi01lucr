THE LIFE OF LUCRETIUS. lxxxiii

aliare of the dust‚ and all turn to dust again Ξ““’;” it surely can be no ini—
peachment of the wisdom or virtue of a sect of heathen phibsophers,
that, after a full and critical examination of this momentous point,
they could not bring themselves to aecredit what was professedly denied
by men who were in possession of an express revelation from heaven.

The belief of a future existence can only result from that of a resurree=
tion of the body after its dissolution‚ or of the survival of the soul as
a separate and independent principle. With respect to the former, al-
though intermixed with a multitude of the grossest conceits imagin-
able, it became an early tenet among the Egyptians, and was strenu-
ously contended for by the Pharisaic Jews, it made little orno progress
in either Greeee or Rome at any time3 and hence, when St. Paul,
with inimitable eloquence, asserted this sublime doctrine at the bar of
Agrippa's court, Festus aecused him of being mad from exeess of learn-

and nothing but the irrefragable proofs we possess of our Saviour’s re-

surrection can affore] us, at the present moment, any full or decisive
evidence upon the subject.

Of the separate survival of the soul, we know as little from any in-
timations afforded by the light of nature, as we do concerning the ro-
surrection of the body. And hence, though the former was a tenet
far more widely acccded to than the latter, it appears to have been

have been general even in the days of Hezekiah, whose reign commenced, at least, three centuries after
>that of solomon ; for, in his prayer to the Almighty for a prolongation of life, Isai. xxxviii. 18, 19. he
expressly asserts, that death cannot celebrate Jehovah—that those who go down to the grave, are without
hope—and that the living alone can praise him.
