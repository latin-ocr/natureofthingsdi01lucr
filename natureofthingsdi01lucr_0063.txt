‘⁶ l know not how to resist the temptation of giving the reader the
landscape of a distant mountain, with the flocks feeding on the
side of it& and I could wish to have set down the description that
immediately follow& of a field of battle†‚ or the subsequent one of a
cow's lamenting her calf that was sa01·ificed‡.—— ’

“ In the beginning of the third book, which opens with the praises
of Epicurus, is a passage, that of itself, without alleging other in-
stances, is sufficient to shew the strength and sublimity of the author’s
imagination ᾗ.

“ This image always put me mind of that exalted one in Milton,
which is so strongly conceived ;

On heavenly ground they stood, and from the shore
They view'd the vast immeasurable abyss,
Outrageous as a sea, dark, wasteful‚ wild,

Up from the bottom turn'd by furious winds

And surging waves, as mountains to assault
Heav'n's height, and with the centre mix the pole Η

“ Our poet adds, in lines as finished and as smooth as Virgil’s‚ that
he then saw the happy and undisturbed state of the gods.

“ On a perusal of this passage, can one forbear erying outh with
the author?
