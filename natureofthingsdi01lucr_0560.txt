DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. ΙΙΙ.

Rara quod ejus enim constat· natura, necesse est

Aeris inter eum primordia multa moveri.

Such has been the lzizguage, and such the popular
idea of all ages ; but Epicurus is the first philosopher
upon record who attempted to reconcile the general
belief and language of mankind with natural phaeno-
mena, and to develop, with the penetrative ken of
science, the constituent parts of that ae'rial substance
from which the sentient principle was supposed to be
derived ; to trace their separation or secretiori ; and to
apportion to each its relative power in the productiori
or renovation of life, perception, and intelligence.

Such being a summary of the Epicurean doctrine
upon this subject, Ι shall next, as briefly as possible,
compare it with what has been advanced in more
modern times, and since chemistry has been con-
nected with physiological pursuits.

And here, the first thing I shall notice is the posi-
tion oancretius‚ that the body derives the whole of its
elementary beat, now denominated caloric, univocally
with his own term calor, from respirable,or atmospheric
air. The cause of animal beat was never fullyor scienti-
fically developed, till the celebrated treatise of the late
Dr. Crawford appeared on this subject, about fifteen
years ago. Pn'or to this aeia, it was attempted to
be accounted for in various, and indeed contradic-
tory ways τ some attributing it to the reciprocal
friction of the different particles of blood3 others,
to their friction against the sides of their vessels:
some referring it to the action of the solids of the
body against the solids; others, again, to fermenta-
tions‚ supposed to be perpetually occurring through
tlic whole system. But none of these solutions were
satisfactory, and every one in turn yielded to the
rest. The experiments, hou-ever, of Dr. Crawford‚
hut more especially those of Lavoisier, who has per-
fected this theory, while they confnte the conjec-
tures hazarded by every former philosopher from
Hippocrates to Cullen, establisli‚ upon tl-ie firmest
basis, the hypothesis advanced by our poet 3 and re-
solve the phaenomenon of animal heat into atmosphe-
ric air, inhaled in the act of respiration‚ and chemi-
cally decompounded in its passage through the lnngs.

The atniosphere is a vast laboratory, in which in-

nnmerable processes of analysis, solution, precipita-
ti0n‚ and combination, are incessantly taking place.
The air itself is a confused mixture of particles
ejected from animahvegetable, and mineral substances,
and more especially from water, either entire or
decomposed, through which the fluids of light, heat,
and electricity, as well as an infinitude of other gasses,
are continually passing and repassing. Vapour,
therefore, of some kind or another, must, at all times,
constitute an essential part of atmospherie air, yet
the portion it constitutes is but small, seldom, in ge-
neral, exceeding a liundredth part of the whole : the
rest consisting of elementary heat, or caloric, a most
active and volatile substance, larg-ely diffused through
all nature, of azotic gass, or mephytis, and of a most
recondite fluid, which it is the boast of modern che-
mistry to have discovered characteristically; which,
when separated, is found to be three or four times
purer than atmospheric air in the gross, and will
hence preserve combustion and animal life three or
four times as long. This mysterious gass, though
suspected by modern chemists, from the era of Van
Helmont‚ was by no means fully maced, or its pro-
per-ties fairly specificated, till the experiments of Dr.
Priestley gave it “ a local habitation and a name :'’
for he obtained it from a variety of substances in a
pure and uncombined state, and denominated it dephlo-
gisticated air; adverting, in this appellation, to a
system of his own founding, and known by the
phrase of the phlogistic system. It soon, however,
became a matter of great doubt, among contempo-
rary chemists, whether there were any such thing as
plilogiston in nature; and hence Lavoisier banished
the name altogether from the French school of che·
mistry, and re-denominated the newly-discovered
aura, vital air, or oxygen. Oxygen, in its state of
purity, and freed from every other substance, is
never volatile, but remains fixed to the body it inha-
bits ; yet combined with the elementary heat or ca·
loric of the atmosphere, it is volatized instantane-
ously, and exhibits itself by a thousand magnificent

and stupendous properties. It is this, indeed, that gives
