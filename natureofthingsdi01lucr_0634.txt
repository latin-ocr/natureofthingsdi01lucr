DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. ΙΙΙ,

Aut quia non veniunt omnino aliena salutis;

Aut quia, quae veniunt, aliqu& ratione recedunt

Pulsa prius, quam, quid noceant, sentire queamus3

[Scilicet zi ver& longe ratione remotum est.]

835

Praeter enim, quam quod morbis tum corporis aegrst,

Advenit id, quod eam de rebus saepe futuris

Maceret, inque metu male habet, curisque fatigat (3

Praeteritisque male admissis peccata remordent,

Adde furorem animi proprium, atque oblivia rerum3

840

Adde quod in nigras lethargi mergitur undas.

the soul: its affection by external circumstances,
and its possession of even a larger share of evils than
those to which the body itsclf is exposed.

With this argument, oin· poet, as just observed, con-
cludts his observatious iu favour of the materiality of
the snul, or sentient principle; and it may nore, pei·-
haps‚ be expected that, in the present comnitntnry, I
should briefly enumerate che chief arguments which
lzavebeen urged on the opposite side of the question, by
different philosophers ofdifferent ages. This, however,
is a task altogether inadmissible: yet,as².hecouute1·-po-
sitions avia-anecd by the Cat-dinal Polignac are more im-
mediately directed against the poem before us, and to a
certainty,constitute the most concentrated and the most
popular system of oppositiou ofany which has hitherto

been urged3 and as nothingofmaterial moment hasbeen
advanced since its publication, I cannot avoid offering
a brief statementof theircontents. They are tobe found
in the fifth and sixth books of the Anti-Lucretius.
ln the note on ver. 101 of the book before us, 1
have given the opinion of our own countryman, Mr.
Locke, respecting the capability of matter to exhibit
the phaenomenou of intelligence‚ together with the
severe attack of the Cardinal upon him for such a
crecd. It is in conjoint repugnance to this celebrated
philosopher, as well as to our own poet, that the ’
cardinal commences his attach, by contending that
the human soul cannot be material from the very na-
ture ofmatter itself; since there is nothing in any of the
modifications of matter, as the position, magnitude,
figure or motion ofits particles,wbence intelligeuce can
result·; modifications which are mere alternating forms
of material things, and can press to nothing beyond.
He next attempts to demonstrate, that spirit has no-
thing in common with matter ; that it must have
existed antecedently to it, and have first of all stimu-
lated it into motion. In reply to the objection‚ that
the sonl is, and must be acted upon by matter, and
