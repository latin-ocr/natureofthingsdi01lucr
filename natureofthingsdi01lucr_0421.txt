While arms of blood the fierce enthusiasts wield

more effect than in other53 yet it does not appear, Ι
believe, in any instance, that this effect, or influence‚
results from a mere assemblage of different sounds, or
rather from a mere assemblage of the concordant
sounds of different diapasons; but is singly excited
by some individual tone of sound, simple and uncom-
bined, and in a certain mysterious manner sympho-
neous with the constitution of the body affected.
DogS, rats, and other animals, who would be fright-
ened away by a sudden burst of music in parts, have
their attention frequently rivetted. in the most
fixed and extraordinary manner, by the operation and
frequent recurrence of certain notes consentaneous
with their feeling-s, or nervous conformation.

The French, among othei· fancies, not long ago
made a public trial of the effect of music upon ele-
phants3 and for this purpose, erected an orchestra
near the booth of a male and female animal of this
description. The concert was opeued with some
light, varied airs, and a base in F major, in the
moderate character: it passed on to a trio, from
Gluck in F minor; a solo, likewise in a minor key,
and some few overtures played in full harmony by
all the band together.

The Dutchman, who is related by Morhoff to
have had a power of breaking goblets and wine-
glasses with his voice when exalted to a certain
pitch, was incapable of producing the same effect
by an equal quantity of sound produced from a com-
bination of different notes; aud must have been so,
though it had equalled the volume of the fifteen
hundred musicians assembled a few years since, at

westminster-abbey, to commemorate the birth of
Handel.

upon the inanimate and brute-cremium, it is impos-
sible that it should not have an equal effect upon
certain combinations or classes of human nerves: and
I am persuaded, that in a variety of diseases, in
which the nervous system is the chief seat of attack,
it might often be introduced with advantage, were
music ever scientifically studied as a braneh of thera-
peutics. Among the ancients‚ we have many dis-
eases mentioned as having been cured by music,
which, 1 am very ready to confess, appear to have
been much more benefited by its mechanical, than
by its sympathetic effects. It was a common pre-
scription in rheumatic and gouty complaintS, as we
learn from Theophrastus, Aulus Gellius, and even
Galen himself. But it is highly probable, that all
its beneficial results, or at least the greater part of
them, in these cases, flowed rather from the exercise
of dancing, with which it was always accompanied,
together with the perspiration, and copious drink-
ing, which atteuded such exercise, than from any
internal or sympathetic influence it was capable
of exerting. XVhen, therefore, Pliny informs uS,
Lib. xxviii. cap. i. upon the authority of Cato, that
persons, with strained and dislocated limbs, had fre-
quently recovered {rom the use of a remedy of this
kind, to render the assertion at all credible, we
must believe, that, from the violence of the strain
in the latter case, the limb had been merely supposed
to have been dislocated‚ than that a reduction of the
luxated bone should hence actually have occurred.
Asthough, undoubtedly, if a man, who had dislo-
catcd his knee or his ancle, could be prevailed upon
to engage in a brisk dance, the action of the dance
itself might as effectually, in some instances, restore
the injured joint to its due situation, as the more
topical and seientific assistance of the chirurgical
practitioner himself.
