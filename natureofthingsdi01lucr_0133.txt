abandoned by the heretics; and the accuracy and legitimacy of rea-
soning, which they acquired by the study of the dialectics of this phi-
losopher, gave them, in much of the common controversy, a manifest
and decidcd advantage. The Christian Fathers were, at length, sensi-
ble of this advantage themselvcs3 and, about the beginning of thev
eighth century, began to discover an inclination to enlist this part of
the Peripatetic philosophy into the banners of their own saith. The
attempt was first introduced by Joannes Damascenes, who flourishcd
· at the period I am adverting to, and retired about the middle of life,
from a high station at the Saracen court, to a monastery at St. Abas,
that he might cnjoy full leisure to prosecute his studies. From this
tera, Aristotle began to obtain an ascendancy over his rivals ; nothing
was heard of but the trivium and quadrivium of the Lycaeum, or that
circle of instruction, into which the liberal arts were at this period di-
vided; the trivium comprising grammar, rhetoric, and dialectics ς and
the quadrivium, music, aritlimetic, geometry, and astronomy: and·
so complete was the triumph of this school at one time, aud so extra— ,
vagant the general attachment to its philosophy, that Melancthon
makes it a matter of complaint, that in sacred asseinblies the ethice
of Aristotle were read to the people, instead of the gospvlr. Some
few and feeble attempts were occasionally made to rcrive thc credit os
Plat0; and in one 01· two instances, and especially under the pcn of
Rosceline, who fiourished in the twelfth century, to introduce the
opinions of Zeno, but they were all of contracted limits and tempor-ary
durati0n3 whence, till the revival of learning in the fourtccnth cen—
tury, may the scholastie system be fairly regarded as maintaining a
complete sway over the mystic, as well as over every other, by which it
was occasionally assaulted. Plato was left in obscurity, the doctrines os
Zeno abandoned, and Epicurus known only by name.
