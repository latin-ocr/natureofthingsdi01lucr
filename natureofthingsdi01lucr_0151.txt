ARGUMENT.

LUCRETms opens his Poem with an invocation to Venus, and then dedicates it to
Memmius 3 briefly treating of its subject, and endeavouring to clear it from the charge
of impiety. He now commences his subject in detail, and attempts to prove that
nothing could spring from, or can return to, nothing; that there are certain minute
corpuscles, which, though imperceptible to the senses, may be conceived by the mind,
and whence every thing originates: that there is also space or vacuum—besides which
nothing is to be traced in Nature ι and that whatever else appears to exist, as weight‚
beat, poverty, history, war, are merely the conjunctions or events, the proper-ties or
accidents, of body and void3 and that these elementary corpuscles are perfectly
solid, indivisible, and eternal. He confutes the opinion of Heraclitus, who held that
fire was the principle of all things3 and of other philosophers‚ who, instead of fire,
maintained the same of air, water, and earth 3 and at length of Empedocles, who
regarded the whole as equally elementary and primordial. He attacks the homoeomery
of Anaxagoras, and 1idicules its absurdity. He contends‚ that the Universe is infinite on
all sides3 that space cannot be limited; and that the property of infinity attaches
equally to body and void. Hence he severely censures those who believe that there
e'xists a central point in the Universe, or admit the doctrine of central gravitation. He
concludes with a brief panegyric upon philosophy, by the light of which-'mankind are

able to penetrate the profoundest mysteries of Nature.
