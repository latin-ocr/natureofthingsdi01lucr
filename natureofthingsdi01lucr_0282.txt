DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. 1.

Atque eadem magni refert primordia saepe

Cum quibu5‚ et quali positura, contineantur3

Et quos inter se dent motus, adcipiantque. “

Namque eadem coelum, mare, terraS, flumina, solem,

820

Constituunt3 eadem frugeS‚ arbusta, animanteis:

Verum, aliis alioque modo conmixta, moventur.

Quin etiam passim nostris in versibus ipsis

Multa elementa vides, multis conmunia verbis;

Quombtamen inter se versuS‚ ac verba, necesse est

825

Confiteare‚ et re, et sonitu distare sonanti:

Tantum elementa queunt, permutato ordine solo!

Lusiad of Camoe'ns; which, indeed, does not exist
in the Portugueze, and is, therefore, entitled to the
additional merit of originality. Speaking of the
altar, he says ε

On it the picture of that shape he plac’d,
In which the holy Spin't did alight ;

The picture of the dove, so white, so chaste,
On the blest virgin's head, so chaste, so white.

camdem, however, was by no means inattentive to
this figure, although it does not form the basis of the
above translation. In the sixth canto, we meet with

the following instance of it ε
—eu desejo

 

Ha muito ja de andar terras estranhas,
Por ver mais agoas que as do Domo, e Tejo,
Varias gentes, e leis, c varias manhas.

Long have I hop’d thro’ foreign elimes to stray‚

Where others treams than Douro wind their way ;

To note what various shares of bliss and woe

From various laws, and various customs flow.

book ii. ver. 606.

But even prose writers, and public oratura, have
not always neglected the cultivation of this rhetori-

cal flower. It would be easy to select instance·
from Demosthenes and Cicero, were it necessary.
Passing these, Ι shall merely oberve, that St. Paul
himself has adopted it, 2 Cor. ix. 8. ινα εν mam wa,-
70³¹! πασᾶν αυτααρκέὖαν ΕχΟΨΓΕς πὲρῦσσξυητὲ Εὗς παν αΎαΘΟῚῖ
“ that, having an all sufficiency at all times in all
thingS, ye may abound in all that is good.’' It would
swell this note to an unnecessary length to cite in-
stances of the same kind from the Hebrew poets. I
refer the reader therefore to note on B. iv. v. 1. where
the subject is resumed.

 

Ver. 887. Thus, though the lines, ] This
comparison is exquisitely apposite and illustrative;
and our poet reeurs to it, and makes a still ampler use
of it in ver. 971 of the present book, which see, as
likewise the note on ver. 974. In the second, and
some of the succeeding books, he also introduces the
same illustration. ³

The argument itself is founded on strict and phi-
losophie fact: and our modern metaphysicians have
often availed themselves of it. Thus Dr. Clarke‚ al-
most in the words of our poet: “ Every thing by
composition, division, or motion, is nothing else but
the very same it was before, taken either in whole or
