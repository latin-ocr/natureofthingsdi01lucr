Ripens in reason, till in equal honr,
As age o’ercomes, and every organ fails‚ 46 5
Fail too his mental powers: then raves the tongue,
The judgment raveS‚ the total man declineS‚
And, in a moment, all alike expires.
Hence the whole nature of this reasoning frame
Must all dissolve, as smoke in ambient air, 470
Hence since, as urg’d above, all springs alike,
All ripens gradual, and together droops
As, too, the body feels full oft the force

Of bitter pains, and many a huge disease-u

So strives the mind with grief, and cruel care, 47 5
Hence prov’d partaker of one common fate.
In many an ill, moreo'er, the fiesh sustains‚
The judgment suffers x the distracted wretch
Now raving wild, and sinking, now profound
In stupid slumber3 his fixt eye-balls stare, 480

His head hangs heavy, sound no more is heard,
