THE NATURE OF THINGS.

Since, then, with universal sway thou rul'st‚

And thou alone3 nor aught without thee springs,

Aught gay or lovely 3 thee I woo to guide

Aright my flowing song, that aims to paint

To MEMMIUS’ view the EssENCEs or THINGs:

MEMMIUS, my friend, by thee, from earliest youth,

O Goddess! led, and train’d to every grace.

Then, Ο, vouchsafe thy favour, power divine!

And with immortal eloquence inspire.

Quell, too, the fury of the hostile world,

And lull to peace, that all the strain may hear.

For peace is thine: on thy soft bosom he,

For a farther account of Caius Memmius Gemellus,
I refer the reader to the life of Lueretius, prefixed
to this volume.

Ver. 32. Quell, too, the fury qs the hostile world, δια]
An ancient commentator upon Statius has justly com-
mended this and the two ensuing verses of Lucretius,
in an annotation upon the following passage, which
is hence obviously borrowed:

O Ξ mitis bellorum requies, et sacra voluptas,
Unaque pax animo ς soli cui tanta potestas
Divorumque, hominumque meis occurrere telis
Impune, et media quamvis in caede frementes
Hos assistere equos, hunc ensem avellere dextra.

O thou, my balm in war, my dear delight‚

And mind's sole quiet—thou, of gods and men,
Unhurt my fatal arms alone who dar’st‚-

Dar’st‚ in the rage of battle, from the chief

To snatch th’ uplifted sword, or, with prompt aid,
Succour th' affrighted courser.

 

 

Ver. 34. on thy sqft bosom he, δία] The de·

scription of this amour is voluptuous, without being

indelicate : and on this latter account more especially,
Lucretius has very considerably the advantage of
either Ariosto or Tasso. Milton perhaps, but Mil-
ton alone, excells him, in his picture of the loves of our
first parents, in the garden of Eden. The purity of
this painting is indeed only equalled by its elegance.

So spake our general mother, and with eyes
Of conjugal attraction unreprov'd,
And meek surrender, half-embracing lean'd
On our first father: half her swelling breast
Naked met his, under the flowing gold
Of her loose tresses hid. He, in delight
Both of her beauty, and submissive charms‚
Smiled with superior love, and press'd her lips
With kisses pure.

PAR. Losr, iv. 493.

Cambens, who, as I have observed before (see Note
on ver. 1.), has imitated Lucretius in attributing to
Venus the power of tranquillizing every sturm, and
restoring happiness to nature, probably had his eye
also directed to this elegant delineation of the same
deity, in his account of her approach to Jupiter, with
a petition in favour of De Gama. The painting is
