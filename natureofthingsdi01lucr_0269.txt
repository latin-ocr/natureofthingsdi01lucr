Its sinuous shores

Th’ IoNIAN main, with hoarse, unwearied wave,

Surrounds, and sprinkkes, with its briny dew τ

And, from the fair AEOLIAN fieIds, divides

With narrow frith that spurns th’ impetuous surge.

to have perished by a fall down the dreadful opening
on the top of Mount AEtna, as the elder Pliny died
by a sall into Vesuvius.

Ver. 776. In cloud-capt sicma] This description
of Sicily is as geographically accurate, as it is poeti-
cally beautiful. The Ionian, or Mediterranean sea, by
which it is principally surrounded, derives its appella-
tion, according to Pliny, from Ionius, the son onyr-
ribachius, who was slain by Hercules, and thrown into
the Mediterranean, to perpetuate his memory. The
frith, which the poetjustly denominantes narrow, is at
present known by the name of the Straits of Messina.
Its breadth between Italy and Sicily is not more than
about half a league. The two countries, indeed, ori-
ginally united, but were separated, according to Fa-
ber, about the era of the Hebrew chief Joshua, by a
most violent hurricane and earthquake.

Ver.781. Here vast Cimiwzms raves :] Charybdis,
according to the latitude in which the termis used
by Thucydides, means the entire Straits of Messina;
but in a more limited and common acceptation, it is
a guff, or vortex, on the immediate coast of Sicily,
now denominated Calefaro, from the continual effer-
vescence of its waters‚ and directly opposite the
Scigla‚ Scylla, or pointed rock that risen off the pro-
montory of Coenis on the Italian side of the strait.
The impetuosity of the current between Sicily and
the rock Scigla, together with the force of the whirl-
pool of Calefaro, has been supposed to render this
passage at all times dangerous to mariners. In stormy
weather‚ indeed, there is still no smail degree of ha-
zard; but, at other periods, the natives of either
country pass and 'repass with little apprehension, and
very few accidents. It afforded the poets of Greece
and Rome, however, ari inexhaustible fund of pica

turesque and sublime imagery ; and their descriptions
of this impetuous passage are often grand and terri-

ble. Thus Homer:

Αλλ’ στ’ αναςροξιε Sancum-ng αλμνρον υὸωρ,

Ποις’ enoc-35 φανεσκε κυκωμενη· αμφι δε ‘irs-tp„

Δεινον εξεέροκει, nonuplis δε yma φανεσκε

‘sappam κυανεη· τους ΣΕ χλωρον δῖος ‘npet-

Ημεις μεν προς την δ” idolam, δεισαντες ολεθρον, &c-
Omrsssv, M.

Now, all at once, tremendous scenes unfold;

Thunder'd the deep& the smoking billowfl
roll'd!

Tumultuous waves embroil’d the bellowing
flood:

All trembling, deafen’d, and aghast we stood ξ

No more the vessel plough’d the dreadful wave ;

Fear seiz'd the mighty, and unnerv'd the brave.
Porz.

It is worth while to compare this passage with the
beginning of that quoted from cameos, in the note
to ver. 149 of this book. Many of the lines in that
extract are a close copy. The parallel passage in
virgil is more : it is a translation.

Tum procul e fluctu Trinacria cernitur AEtna ε
Et gemitum ingentem pelagi, pulsataque saxa
Audimus longe, fractasque ad litora voces ;
Exultantque vada, atque :estu miscentur arenae, &e-
ΖΕΝ. lib. 3.
Mount AEtna thence we spy,
Known by the smoky flames which cloud the sky.
Far off we hear the waves‚ with surly sound
Invade the rocks ; the rocks their groans resound ἵ
The billows break upon the sounding strand,

And roll the rising tide, impure with sand.
Davum.
