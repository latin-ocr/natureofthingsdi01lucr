or source of all forms and ideaS, which, with Plato, are nearly eonver-
tible terms; an idea, properly so called, being an intellectual form,
and a form, literally so denominated, a visible idea. From the union,
then, of the logos, or Divine Reason, with matter, proceeded un nui-
mated world, and sensible or eorporeal existences. The kind of union
supposed to subsist between the Divine Reason or exemplar, and the
Deity itself‚ it is difficult to explain, or even to conjecture. In some
part of his writings, and especially in his Timaeus, Plato seems to regard
the former as a being impersonaled and distinct 110111 the efficient
Cause; but, in general, he speaks of it as a mere inedium or instrument
employed, and he was thus commonly understood by philosophers of
contemporary schools. Hence Seneca, in express allusion to this doc-
trine, asserts‚ that “ the exemplar is not the efficient cause of reason,
but an instrument necessary to the cause Ψ ;'’ and hence, too, Laertius
expressly regards itas nothing more than the mind or reason itself of
the immaterial Deity Τ. Be this, however, as it may, since unfashioned
matter eonstitutes the third substance in this triad of creative powers,
the trinity of Plato can bear 110 possible resemblance, in its first and
undisgujsed declaration, to the trinity of the Christian church. What-
ever, then, may become of the divine logos or exemplar, it is evident,
that Plato coneeived the existence of two eterna] and independent
causes of all things; the one, that by which all things are created,
which is G0d; and the other, from which all things are created, which
is matter: and, in this respect, he completely assimilated his views with
the Epicurean hypothesis He eoneeived, however, independently of
this tenet, that unfashioned matter had a 50111 of its own, exclusive
of the animating and intelligent energy it received from the supreme
Areliiteet3 and in this tenet seems to consist the chief absurdity of
the. Platonic hypothesis; for he hereby appears, in a. great degree, to
