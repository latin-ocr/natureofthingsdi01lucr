ARGUMENT.

THE Poet describes the pleasures that result from the study of philosophy, and a¹
mind satisfied with a little, and estranged from the passions and pursuits of the busy
world. He then resumes his subject, and attempts to prove a perpetual motion in
primordial atoms; and that this motion is of various kinds, direct, curvilinear, and
repercussive. He asserts, that primordial atoms are not all of the same figure3 some
being globular, others polygonal‚ and others jagged: that these figures vary not to
infinitude3 but that the atoms under every separate figure are infinite in number.
The formation of compound bodies from the combination of atoms of different figures,
and the variation of their solidity or fluidity, their roughness or rotundity, from the
different atoms of which they are compounded3 and the degree of force and affinity,
or connexion with which they adhere to each other. Prismatic hues, and their origin3
reflaction of colours‚ and its cause. Neither these, nor any other qualities of bodies,
reside in primordial atoms themselves, but only in their peculiar arrangements and
combinations. The origin of irritability‚ sensatim, and apprehension: the immensity
of creafion, from the immensity of its materials—and, consequendy, the existence of
other systems, and systems of systems of worlds. No compound material being
eternal—whence no system of material atoms can be eterna13 and whence, again, the
progression, senescence‚ and decay of every existing world, the ruins, or disorganised
corpuscles of which will be employed in the generation and maturity of other worlds.

Proofs‚ that the earth is already in a state of decline and comparative infertility3 and

hence, that it must, eventually‚ perish from senility alone.
