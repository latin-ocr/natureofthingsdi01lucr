DE RERUM NATURA.

Nam medium nihil esse potest, ubi inane locusque

Possit ibei quidquam hac potius consistere caussa,

Quam qua vis alifi longe regione manere.

Omnis enim locus, ac spatium, quod inane vocamus,

Per medium, per non medium‚‘concedat oportet

Nec, quod inane autem est, ulli subsistere debet,

Quin, sua quod natura petit, concedere pergatt

and elegance will frequently cast upon those who
differ from them iu opinion, and merely on account
of such difference. According to the discovm‘es of
modern, and more accurate philosophy, the oppo-
nents of Lucretius were, in the present instance,
much nearer the truth than himself. But they had
imbibed a contrary system to his own ς and what fol-
lows? the system they had imbibed must be false
and fancisul‚ and they had only imbibed it from
vanity or perversity os mind. How much is it to
be lamen-ted that men, in other respects most liberal
and praise-worthy, should so frequently indulge in
reflections so uncharitable and disingenuous, upon
subjects of but speculative consideration alone 3 and
thus discover, where we should least expect to find
it, so large a portion of the pride and rancour of
the human beart ?

But. what was merely deemed idle, extravagant2

or perverse, in the days of Lucretius, on the intro-
ductiou of the Christian religion, and for many cen-
turies afterwards, was regarded as a high crime and
heresy: and the punishment of imprisonment‚ con-
fiscation, and death, was scarcely severe enough to*
atone for the diabolical dogma. In the note on
Book ii. v. 1065, I have stated with what terror
Copernicus at length consented to disclose to a few
friends the principles of that system which is now
universally accredited throughout Christendom‚ after
having concealed it from public notice for at least
thirty years, Yet so much did he dread a prose-
cution for heresy, even after he had divulged it,
that it is generally believed he fell a sacrifice to this
apprehension alone. For asserting the same system,
to wit, that the sun is in the centre, and not the
earth 3 and that the latter has a diurnal motion, and
is inhabited in its antipodal regions, Galileo was im*
