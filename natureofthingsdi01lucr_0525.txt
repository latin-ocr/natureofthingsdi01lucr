THE NATURE OF THINGS.

2375

For as the doctrines of thy godlike mind

Prove into birth how nature first uprose,

All terrors vanish3 the blue walls of heaven

Fly instant-and the boundless void throughout

Teems with created things.

20

Then too we trace

The powers immortal, and their blest abodes;

Scenes where the winds rage neverssunobscur’d

By clouds, or snow white—drifting,—-—and o'erspread

With laughing ether, and perennial day.

25

There nature fills each want, nor aught rip—springs

Ver. 19. All terrers vanish ,¹ ] It is to this
passage Bruno alludes in the following exulta-
tion: Spento a fatto il terror vane e puerile della
morte, si conosco una parte della felicita chi apporta
ia nostra contemplazione secundo i fundamenti della
nostra filosofia: atteso che lei toglo il fusco ulo de
pazzo sentimento circa l’orco, ed avaro Caronte,
onde il piu dolce della nostra vita ne si rape, ed
avvelena. Della Causa, PrincipiO, &c. “ The
vain and puerile fear of death is extinguished‚ when

 

once a man is acquainted with but a single part of that
felicity which a contemplation of the principles of
our philosophy essentially produces ; for till then, the
thick darkness of idle conjecture respecting hell, and
avaritious Charon, hurries him away, empoisoning,
and totally destroying almost all the happiness of his
life.’'

Ver. 23. Scene: where the winds ruge never—un-
obscur’d

By clouds, or snow white-drffting,—and o’er-

spread

With Iaughing ether, andperennial day.] I have

had occasion to observe before, in note on Book Ι.

ν. 57, that the state of tranquillity and beatitude, at-

tributed by Lucretius to the angelic natures who

form his secondary gods, perfectly coincides with

various descriptions of Homer respecting the gods of
the people. The passage before us is obviously imi-
tated from the following ε

‘H μεν αρ’, ὦς ειπους, απεςη ’γλαυκωπις Abram
Ovzvssswoffl, ὅθι φασι Sem ἕδος, ασφαλες aas»,
Εμμεναι· ευτ’ ανεμοισι rimmo-wat, ουτε ποτ’ ομξρω
Δευεται· oms χιων επιπιλιαται· aava μοι). αιθρη
nez-mma ανεφελος, λευκη δ’ επιδρεὲομεν αιγλη.

Ουγεε. Ζ. 42.

The seat of god5‚ the regions mild of peace,

Full joy, and calm eternity of ease z

There no rude winds presume to shake the skies,

No rains descend, no snowy vapours rise3

But on inunortal thrones the blest rcpose

While the bright heaven with living lusti-e glows.
Pom-z.

Not widely different Mr. Cumbcrland, in the fol-
lowing verses, which comprize a part of the dialogue

between Satan and Gabriel:

Hcaven knows no wintcr5 there no tempests
howl :

To breathe perpetual spring, to sleep supine

On flowery beds of amaranth, and rose,

Voluptuous slavery, was Gabriel's choice.
