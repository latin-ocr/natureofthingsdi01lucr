DE RERUM NATURA.

[ΑΒ.Ἰ ,Ῑ.

Adspectuque suo lacrumas ecfundere civeis;

Muta metu, terram, genibus submissa, petebat}

Nec miserae prodesse in tali tempore quibat,

Quod patrio princeps donarat nomine regem:

Nam, sublata virfim manibus, tremebundaque, ad aras

Deducta est3 non ut, solemni more sacrorum

Perfecto, posset claro comitari hymenaeo;

Sed, casta inceste, nubendi tempore in ipso,

Nothing can be more unfaithful to the original, or
more inconsistent with the sentiment our poet is en-
deavouring to inculcate, than Coutures’ version of
this beautiful passage. He is protesting against the

 

feelings of nature, he represents the sufferings of
Agamemnon as extreme: he stood, as it should ap-

consent to the sacrifice. Yet Contures has repre-
sented him as a monster, void of all parental feeling;
not irresistibly enforced, but aelf-determined to
offer up his daughter, and peremptorily resolved
that no entreaties should dissuade him from so
sanguinary an oblation. “ It was in vain‚'’ says he,
“ that she attempted to soflen the king, by calling him

“ her father: she was seized by pitiless hands, and
“ carried trembling to the foot of the altar-‚⁷³
