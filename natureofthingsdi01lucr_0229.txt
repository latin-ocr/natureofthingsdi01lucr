ΤΗΕ NATURE OF THINGS.

81

By wisdom fed, so largely have Ι drank,

And such the dulcet doctrines yet untold‚

That age may first unman us, and break down

The purple gates of life, ere the bold muse

Exhaust the boundless subject.

Haste we, then, 465

Each pulse is precious, haste we to proceed.

Know, then, th’ ENT1RE OF NATURE sole consists

Of SPAcE and BODY: this the substance mov'd,

And that the area of its motive pow'r.

That there is BODY, ev'ry sense we boast

470

Demonstrates strong: and, if we trust not sense,

Source of all scienoe, then the mind itself‚

Perplex’dand hopeless, must still wander on,

In reas’ning lost, to ev'ry doubt a prey.

of the necessity of trusting to the external sen-
ses, and the superiority of their evidence over evi-
dence of a different kind, forms the foundation of
the philosophy of Dr. Beattie, Dr. Reid, and other
pillars of “the Rcssective School’' of Scotland‚ as they
lately seemed desirous of calling themselves; in op-
position to the analogical school, which, generally
speaking, might embrace almost all philosophers but
themselves. The arguments adduced by these lite-
rati may, in some degree, and as they were princi-
pally intended, attack the systems of Hume and
Berkley, who denied an external existence ; but they
must necessarily be feeble in controverting the doc-
trines of Spinoza, Hobbes, or Des cartes. See note
on verse 535 of this book, and verse 488 of book iv.
as also the Appendix to the prefixed life of Lucretius.

vot. I.

This appeal of mankind at large to the testimony
of the external senses, is noticed by Ariosto, in his
Orlando Furioso3 who is fearful that, on account of
the prevalence ofsuch principle, his mysterious tales, so
totally repugnant to all the experience they offer, will
obtain but little credit with the world.

Il sehioeeo volgo non gli vuol dar fede

Se non le vesle, e tocca chiare, e piane.

Per questo io so, che l’inesperienza

Fara al mio canto dar pora credenza.

CANT. vii.

The herd unlettcr'd nothing will believe
But what their senses plainly ean perceive.
Hence I shall ne'er with common minds prevail‚

And gain but trivia] credit for my tale. H
