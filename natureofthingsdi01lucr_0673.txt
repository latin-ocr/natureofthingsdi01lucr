THE NATURE OF THINGS.

The Forum, CERBERUS, and HELL itself

Of light devoid, and belching from its jaws

Tremendous fireS, live not, nor can they live:

1050

But well they paint the dread of justice here

For crimes atrocious‚ the reward of guih,

The scourge, the wheel, the block, the dungeon deep,

The base-born hangman, the TARPEIAN cliff3

Which, though the villain ’scape, his conscious soul

1055

Still fem-s perpetual, tort'ring all his days,

And still forebocling heavier pangs at death.

The seat of Desolation, voidcffligl·t‚
Save what the glimmering of these lividstames

Casts pale and dreiidful.
PAR. Losr, i. 181.

The following description of Gesner will not ap-
pear contemptible, and it may be amusing to have an
opportunity of comparing it: “ Der fiii-chterliche wie-
derschein, den jenseit der gebiirge emporwallende
flammen in die wolken hinstreuten, goss braune
di'imniruug auf das schwarze dunkel.’⁷ “ The fear-
sul reflexion which the ssickering flames on the op-
posite side of the hill scattered through the clouds,
gave a dun twilight to the black darkness-3²

Cicero has an admirable passage, in oue of his ora-

tions, to the same effect : Nolite putare, quemadmo-

dum in sabulis, eos qui aliquid impie, scelerateque

commiserunt, agitari, et perterreri furiarum taedis

ardentibus: sua quemque fraus, suus terror maxime
vexat, suum quemque scelus agitat, amentiaque affi-
cit, suae malae cogitationes conscientiaque animi ter-
rent. Hae sunt impiis assiduae domesticaeque furiae,
quae dies noctesque parentum paenas Ξι conscelera-
tissimis filiis repetunt. Pro Ros. Amer. “Do
not imagine, as fabulous history teaches ue, that
they who have committed any impious or atro-
cious deed are haunted‚ and terrified by the flaming
torches of the furies: every man’s own iniquity,
the terror of every one's own mind—these are
what principally disturb him; he is haunted and
driven mad by his own misdeed53 he is startled
by his own conscience, and his own dreadful ap-
prehensions. These are, with the wicked, those
perpetual and domestic furies that night and day
avcuge the sufferings of parents on their flagitious

offspringst
