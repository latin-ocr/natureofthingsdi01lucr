DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. III.

Quam primordia sentiscant concussa anima'i',

Semina, corporibus nostris inmixta per artus ;

Et quam, intervallis tantis tuditantia, possint

395

Concursare, coire, et dissultare vicissim.

Et magis est animus vita'i' claustra coercens,

Et dominantior acl vitam, quam Vis animai.

Nam sine mente, animoque, nequit residere per artus

Temporis exiguam partem pars ulla anima'1'3

400

Sed comes insequitur facul, et discedit in auras,

Et gelidos artus in leti frigore linquit.

At manet in vitei, quoi mens,

animusque, remansit,

Quam vis est, curtum caesis, lacer undique membris:

TrunCUS, adempta anima, circum, membrisque remotUS,

405

Vivit, et aetherias vitaleis subscipit auras 3

Si non omnimodis, ut magnai parte, animai

Ver. 40 ς. ——— through every sev‘ring space

Blendiug, rebomrding, and reblc’nding still.-]
Our poet alludes to the hypothesis that universally
prevailed respecting the flow of the blood, prior to
the discovery of its circulatim, and which taught
that the blood, when ejected from the beart, was first
conveyed by an infinitude of radiating vessels to the
different organs of the body, and then meandred
through them in distinct panidos, affording nutri-
ment by their perpetual motion; a motion which
was continued by the re—action of particle against
particle, and occasionally by their mutual attraction ς
in the language of our poet, by their ‘¹ blending‚
rebmmding, and reblending still.” According to
the Epicurean philosophy, the supply of sensation
was conducted in the same manner: and hence the
corpuscles of the percipient principle were separately

diffused through every organ of the body, in propor-
tion to the quantity it required for the discharge of
its peculiar function ; the praecordia being the fountain
whence such corpuscles issued, and consequently en-
dowed in a pre-eminent degree with animation and
intelligence.

Ver. 413·

 

the ice qs death .·] [n the original :
Et gelidos artus in leti frigore linquit.

In like manner, Mason, in his English Garden :

the frore severity of death.

 

So, in au ancient poem by Shirley‚ noticed in
Percy's Reliques:

Death lays his icy hands on kings.
