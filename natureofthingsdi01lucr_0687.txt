THE NATURE OF THINGS.

537

To him who yesterday the light forsook,

Than him who died full many a year before.

Sink-—void of laws to burst the marble tomb‚
To ether call us, and With life relume.

Beattie has several exquisitely beautiful and plain-
tive stanzas on the same subject. It would occupy
too much space to copy the whole, but I cannot
avoid transcribing the following :

'Tis night, and the landscape is lovely no more ;

I mourn—but, ye woodlands! I mourn not sor

you 3

For morn is approaching your char-ms to restore,

Perfum’d with fresh fragrance, and glitt'ring with

dew.

Nor yet for the ravage of winter I mourm—

Kind Nature the embryo blossom will save :--

But when shall Spring visit the moulderiug urn Ι

O when shall it dawn on the night qs the grave !

It is probable, however, that both Jortin and Beattie
have been partly indebted for the ideas eonveyed in
these passages, to that unrivalled and inexhaustible
treasure of sublimity and pathos, the book of Job,
which thus offers us a parallel description in Ch. xiv.
v, 7—10.

7 When falls the tree, hope still the fall survive: ;
The fractur'd stock re-pullulates and thrives.
8 Though sunk in years its root, its truuk in death,
9 Once let it scent the fountain's fragrant breath,
Its dormant spirit shall renew its power,
New tresses soliate, and new budlets [lower.
10 But man departs--exhausts life‘s little span,
Yields up his quiv’ring breath—and where is
man ?

Nothing can equal the boldness or the beauty of
the phrase in ver. 9, of this exquisite passage:
ΕΜ) ΠθἾ “ the fragrance,” or rather, ‘⁴ the sra-
grant exhalation of water.’' The Arabians still em-

ploy the very same term 6²) to express the same

idea of brtath, fragrante, or exhalation, indiscrimi-
nately. Yet, is the phrase neither more bold nor
more beautiful than the catachresis, in the latter part
of the same verae, of hair or tresses (⁸1⁹3p) for
branches or Jbliage. Oui· common version interpr-ets*
this word by the tamer term boughs; but the vul.
gate preserves the image in its full force: “fiscia
conam quasi cumprimum ηΔΝτΔτυΜ est.”
