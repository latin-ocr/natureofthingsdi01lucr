ΤΗΕ NATURE OF THINGS.

517

With broad, rough rock impending o’er his head,

And craz’d with terror, there is never seen ε

But terror dwells with mortals—fate they fear, ,

1020

And fortune, and a host of fancied gods.

Nor TITYUs there exim, the prey of birds.

Nor, though he did, could these the victim's breast

Consume for ever3 e’en though his wide bulk,

Not thrice three acres merely might extend,

1025

But cover the vast globe; nor could he bear

Eternal pain, nor yield perpetual food.

But he is Trrws, and by vultures torn,

Whose anxious breast the tage of love devours ;

incessant gore the liver in his breast, ⁷

Th’ immortal livet grOWS, and gives th’ immortal
feast.

For, as o'er Panope’s enamell’d plains

Latona journey'd to the Phthian sanes,

With haughty love th’ audaeious monster strove

To force the goddess, and to rival Jove. Poris.

Macrobius conceives this celebrated fable to pre-
figure a different affection of the mind from that of-
fered by Lucretius; and to refer to the everlasting
etings of a guilty conscience, preying, without inter-
rupfion, upon the bosoms of the wicked, Som-
Scip. i. 10, while Lope de Vega transfers to Tantalus
the allusion which Lucretius finds in Tityus. The
verses of the Spanish poet, upon this subject, are
beautiful, and well worth inserting and translating.
They occur in the Hermosura de Angelica:

Qerer y non degirlo, arder y clame,
Y, elandose, en el fuego consumirse‚

Mirar con sed el agua, y refrenat-se ;

Acometer el bien, y arrepentirse ς

Aver de ser el mal, y dilatarse,

Tener la possession, y despedirse,

Es la pena de Tantalo, que luego

Qe mira amor, no lo es, que amor es ciego.
CAur. xvi.

To wish, yet ne’er divulge—to burn, yet freeze3
And e'en, while freezing, to consume with fire3
To view the brool< athirst, yet never seize ς
To aim at bliss, and then repent in ire3
To tread o'er ills still lengthening at the touch,
To grasp delights that all possession sputu——
Such is the fate of TANTALvs—and such
To love the fair, that loves not in return.
