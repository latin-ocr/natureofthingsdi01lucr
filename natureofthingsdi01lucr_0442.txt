DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. ΙΙ.

755

Praeterea, si nulla coloris principiis est

Reddita natura, et variis sunt praedita formis,

E quibus omnigenos gignunt,

variantque, colores ;

Praeterea, magni quod refert semina quaeque

Cum quibus, et quali positurfi, contineantur,

760

Et quos inter se deut motus, adcipiantque ;

Perfacile ex templo rationem reddere possiS‚

Quur ea, quae nigro fuerint paullo ante colore,

Marmoreo fieri possunt candore repente:

Ut mare, quom magnei commorunt aequora ventei‚

Ver. 770. Mmh, then, impert [ἶν’ arrangement, and
the powers,

‘The kinds, connexions ffprimordialsmls‚ &c.]

It is the language of Mr- Locke, and expressed
with his own precision. Without multiplying ex-
tracts from his invaluable Essay, compare the pre-
sent passage of our poet with the latter half of the
sentence quoted from it in the note on verse 754 of
the present book: “ It has indeed, such a configu-

radon, &c.’'

Ver¹ 776. Thus, when lond tempests tear the tor-
tur'd maim] This change of colour in the
ocean is thus accurately remarked, as well as beau-

tifully described, by Ovid :

Fluctibus erigitur, coelumque aequare w‘detm·
Pontus ; et inductas aspergine tangere nubes.
Et modo, cum fulvas ex imo vertit arenas,
Concolor est illis ς Stygia modo nigrior unda3
Sternitur interdum, spumisque sonantibus albet.

Menam. l. xi. ν. 497.
Up mounts the main tow'rds heaven, with giddy
surge
Lashing the clouds : now from the dread abyss
Sweeping the yellow sancis, through every wave

765

Itself as yellow-—blacker now than hell,
And now wide-whitening with resounding foam.

The poet, as well as the painter‚ is, therefore,
left almost at liberty as to his choice of colour, when
describing so variable a body as the ocean: and
hence, with almost every colour has it been occa-
sionally endowed. Ovid, in the above verses, has
arrayed it in three diversitics of hue‚-black, white,
and yellow; and every one remembers the green
vestment which Shakspeare attributes to it in that
fearful soliloquy of Maebeth 2

Will all great Neptune’s ocean wash this blood

Clean from my hand? no3 this my hand will
rather

The multitudinous sea incarnardine,

Making the green one red.

Nor is it in its liquid state alone that the sea thus
changes in its hues: when convertcd into icc, the
colours evinced are nearly as numerous and opposite.
Thomson‚ therefore, and Ambrose Philips, are
both equally true to Nature 3 though each pictures
the icy mountains of the northern regions with a
different tincture3 the former telling us that

Thron’d in his palace of cet-ulma ice
Here Winter holds his unrejoicing court. Verr 7.,
