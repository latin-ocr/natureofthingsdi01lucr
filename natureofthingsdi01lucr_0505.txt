οι· Aphrodite Demeter, under the character of Diana.
The word Dios is still the common term for God
in the Spanish language ; and hence the Italian Dio,
and the French Dieu.

From the proper term Noah, the builder of the
ship, the Greeks also derived the substantive (Ναυς)
Naus, the ‘⁴ ship” itself‚ and Dan’dus or Da-N‘aus
which is literally “the ship or ark ;'' and the en-
tire fable respecting whom, including the fifty sons
and daughters, or priests and priestesses, that were
united together, and the leaky vessel or ark that
the latter were sentenced to pour water into for ever,
originates, as is shewn in the note on Book iii. 1046,
from the arkite idolatry of Babylonia, or perhaps,
more immediately from the religious rites of Isis
and Osiris, which constitute but a type of the
former. From the Greek term Naus (Ναυς) the
Latins derive their navis; and it is curious to ob-
serve, that almost every modern language of Europe
has acquired its name for a ship or water—vessel,
either from Noah the builder of the vessel, or the
hip or ark he constructed, from the fabricator or
the fabric itself.

The deification which the idolatrous descendants of
Ham conferred upon their common progenitor Noah,
they also conferi-ed upon Ham himself, and hence he
too was regarded as the Thoth, Xuth, Zeus, or su-
preme god of his people. Surveying no object
around them so powerful and glorious as the sun,
these deities were next compared to the sun, and de-
duced their titles from him.

princes of the East, they were denominated lords of

Like the present

the sun, the moon, or the stars, and often denomi-
nated the sun himself. Hence Ammon or Hammon,
(Ham-On,) is literally Ham the Sun ς the shrine of
whom, under the additional title of Jupiter Ammon,
which was situated in the desart bordering upon
Egypt, was the most renowned of any in antiqnity.
It is probable that the origin of all solar worship pro-
ceeded from such an appropriation of titles, and it
easily accounts for that intermixture of tffms which
wc meet with in many ancient names, obviously of

Chaldaic origin, and the combination‚ and frequently
the confusion, of these different systems of idolatry.
Thuth and Ham, in consequence hercof, were re-
garded as the sun himself, or the pure etherial hea-
vens in which he resides, and whence he distributes
his blessings; hence from Thmh, Thoth, or Thor‚
we de1·ive(Ai-Thor) AEther‚ the region or temple of
Thor‚ the Sun, or aniter: and hence Jupiter and
AEther, amidst the Greeks and Romans, were con-
vertible terms. But the supreme origin ot'all things, as
I have before obse-med, was also represented, in arkite
idolatry, under the feminine gender, as the Aphro-
dite, Venus Demeter, orcommon mother of all created
beings. And hence the term Ai-Thor was also applied
to this female divinity, who was denominated by the
Egyptians HAQoep’ and Πὰθϊξ. (Atl10r): whence
Pleu->p &fid-K! the city of Venus or Athor3 the
Αταρςηχις of Herodotus, lib. ii. 41 ; and Thyatira in
Lybia. And whence, in all probability, the Thor or
divinity of the Goths. The Gothic Thor‚ however,
was a masculine deity, and ofcourse synonymous with
the Xuth of the Chaldeans‚ and the Xuth-Pi-Ait-Or‚
or, with a Doric contractiori, Xu’-P’-Ait-Ov
(Jupiter, the place or region ofinspiration of Xuth
the Snn) of the Romans ;—hence‚ in hebdomenal
time, the Dies Jovis and Thursday or Thor’sday are
appropriated to the same period. Xuth, according to
Herodotus, vii. 94, had a son whose name was (Im)
Ion, and the Ionians were denominated from him:
but the true interpretation of the term Ion is “a
dove :⁷⁹ and it is hence obvious, observes Mr. Alwood,
whence this fable originates, the Ion or Dove having
been put forth from the ark by Xuth in quest of dry
land. whence also the appropriation of this bird to
Venus, who was a symbol of the ark deified under a
female form. Herodotus tells usin the same passage,
that the inhabitants of Achaea, prior to the arrival of
Danaus and Xuthus‚ were called Pelasgi AEgiales, bnt
that on this event they changed their name to
lonians.

ferred to the sun and the starry firmament, proceedsd
