xxxx-i THE LIFE OF LUCRETIL’S.

In the neighbourhood osRonie, therefore, he fixed his peaceful abmie,
and devoted himself altogether to the purc pleasures of philosophy and
domestic life. His two most intimate friends appear to have been Cas-
sius and Memmius. Cassius, like himself, was a strenuous supporter
of the doctrines, as well as defendes of the character opricurus; and
Cicero has expressly noticed the continuance of his attachment to the
Lucretii, even after ourpoet's dece-ase. One ofthis family, in particular,
hc still denominatos the bosom-friend of Cassius, and proves, that
they were in the habit of maintaining a close and intimate correspond-
cnce when at a distance from each other ἦ. To Memmius our poet de-
dicated the work that has inimortalized him; and accompanied him
to Bithynia, in conjunction with Catullus, and the celebrated gram-
marian Curtius Nicas, upon his appointment to the government of
that province 1 In an early period of life, 116 married a lady whose
name was Lucilia, but with whose family we are not aeq uainted, though
from such nume, in conjunctior} with several other circumstances, it
is no improbable conjecture, that she was a sister of Lucius Lucilius,
who joined the confederacy against Caesar, and, by personating Bru-
tus in his unfortunate engagement with Marc Anthony, enabled him
to escape from the hands of the victorious army. The friendship
which, froin having conniienced in their boyish dayS, subsisted without
interruption, or even diminution, between this extraordinary society
of virtuous and aceomplished youths, extended in many instances to
their families and collateral connexioms, and laid the foundation for
a variety ot' iuterinarriagcs. It was hence, that Quintus Cicero mar-
rivd Pomponia, the sister of Pomponius Atticus3 and Cassius, Julia,
the sister of Marcus Brutus. Lucilius was the bosom-friend of Bru-
tus and Cassms5. and Cassius the bosom-friend of Lucretius; and it
15 thus highly probable, that the Lucilia, who was the wife of Lucre-
tius, was a sister of the Lucilius in question.
