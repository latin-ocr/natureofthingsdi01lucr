Qualibus in tenebris vitae, quantisque periclis,

DE RERUM NATURA.

’ Lm. 11.

Degitur hocc' aevi, quodquomque est! Nonne videre est,

Nihil aliud sibi naturam latrare, nisi ur, quoi

Corpore sejunctus dolor absit,

mente fruatur

Jocundo sensu, cura semota, metuque ?

Ergo corpoream ad naturam pauca Videmus

Esse opus omnino, quae demant quomque dolorem ;

Ver. 16. know ye not
Os all ye toil fhr nature nothing asks] Never
have the practice or the precepts of any philosopher
been more misrepresented and libelled than those of
Epicurus. Indoleuce, and mere animal gmtification,

 

have been generally supposed to constitute the re·
sult of all his lessons, and the characteristic of all
his philosophy. A life of indolence, however, could
never have given either Epicurus, or Lucretius, that
truly wonderful extent of knowledge, that deep re-
search into the most curious phaenomena of nature,
and that power of argumentatively elucidating their
own doctrines from facts, and, for the most part,
from facts alone, which are to be traced in almost
every page of this inimitable poem. And as to their
corporeal pleasures let the passage before us speak,
a passage perfectly consonant with the general pre-
cepts and practice of their system, and in which we
meet with a rigid‚ and almost anchorite abjuration
of every thing the world calls gratification or indul-
gence. In reality‚ the pleasures pursued and re-
commended :by Epicurus were entirely of the nega-
tive kind: pleasures easily procured, and almost in
every instance devoid of mutability. Solomon him-
self was never more convinced of the vanity of all
earthly pursuits and enjoyments than the Grecian
moralist3 nor does the Christian system inculcate a
greater purity of life and manners. “ Happiness,'’
observes the philosopher, and it is to this passage
Lucretius refers, ‘⁵ is the end of our being: but to
be happy, we must be free from all pain of body3
and from all trouble and vexation of mind: every

thing actually required by nature is easily obtained,
and that only is obtained with difficulty which is
beyond her wants: we hence call competency our

chief good.’'

Ι agree with Mr. Hume that Tasso had the ex·
ordinm of the present Book strongly in his eye when
he composed the fascinating address of the fair phan-
tom, in Armida's guden, to Rinaldo 3 but 1 cannot,
with him,adrnit that this Address contains all the spirit
of the Epicurean system. The passage is as follows:

O giovineffi, mentre Aprili, e Maggio
V' ammantan di fiorite, e verde spoglie3
Di gloria o di virtu fallace raggio
La tenerella mente ab non v’ invoglie.
Solo chi segue cio, che piace ὲ saggio,

E in sua stagion degli anni il frutto coglie,
Qesto grida natura ς οι· dunque voi
Indurerete l’alma ai detti suoi ἓ

Folli perche gettate il caro dono,
Che breve ὲ si, di vostra eta novella ἓ
Nomi senza foggetto‚ idoli sono
Cio che pregio, e valore il mondo appella.
La fama, che invaghisce a un dolce suono
Voi superbi mortali, e par si bella,
E* un eco, un segne, anzi del sogno un’ ombra,
Ch’ ad ogni vento si dilegna, e sgombra.

Goda il corpo sicuro, e in lieti oggetti
L’ alma tranquilla appaghi i sensi frali ς
