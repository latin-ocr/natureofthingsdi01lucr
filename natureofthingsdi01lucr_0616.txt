DE RERUM NATURA.

Lus. ΙΙΙ.

Corpore: quapropter mortale utrumque putandum est ;

In multas quoniam parteis disciditur aeque.

Praeterea, si inmortalis natura anima‘i'

670

Constat, et in corpus nascentibus insinuatur3

Quur super ante actam aetatem meminisse nequimus,

Nec vestigia gestarum rerum ulla tenemus ?

Nam, si tanto opere est animi mutata potestas,

Omnium ut actarum exciderit retinentia rerum3

Non, ut opinor, id ab leto jam longiter errat.

Quapropter fateare necesse est, quae fuit ante,

Interiisse3 et, quae nunc est, nunc esse creatam.'

Ver. 679. Grani, too, the soul immortal,and infus’d,
Al earliest birth, within us,—whence‚ resolve,

now proceeds, with much dexterity, to attack the opi-
nions of all those philosophers, who contended either
for a state of pre-existence, or a metempsychosis; doc-
trines which were peculiarly espoused by Pythagoras
and Plato, who conceived that human souls, which
consisted of a divine idea, united to a portion of the
soul of the world, were created long anterior to the
generation of the corporcal fmme, and, residing in
some other sphere than the earth, stood prepared to
enter, at a moment's warning, into the microscopic
body of the human embry0‚ at the first instant of
conception. The difficulty of admitting the imme-
diate presence of the Creator, in every act of copula-
tion‚ however unhallowed and impure, for the pur-
pose of providing an immateria'i spirit for the occa-
sion, has driven many immaterialists of modern times
into a similar belief. But if the soul‚ the thinking
principle, did pre-exist, how then, as Lucretius justly
inquires, can it have lost its toral knowledge of all
prior transactions ? and-how again, isit have done so,

can it be otherwise than a new, and altogether differ-
ent being in the body, from what it was in its state
of anterior existence ? since consciousness is the sole
foundation of all personal identity. From the per-
plexity introduced by these queries among ancient
philosophers, there was but one mode of clear escape ς
and that was by cutting the Gordian knot that en-
tangled them, and boldly contending, that all con-
sciousness of such pre-existence was not lost; and
that many of the transactions which had occurred in
it, may be recalled to recollection by any man who
will enter deeply into the study of the whole of his
anterior being. This was denominated by Plato the
doctrine of reminiscence, and was one of the most im-
portant tenets of the Academie philosophy. Em-
pedocles and Pythagoras advanced still farther ; and
hardily declared, not only that they had existed an-
tecedently, and had a general idea of such existence,
and the facts with which it was accompanied, but
that they recollected, most perfectly‚ the very names
of the persons whose bodies they had at distinct pe-
riods inhabited. The former, indeed, for every purpose
ot general inforrnati0n2had been particularly fortunate 3
