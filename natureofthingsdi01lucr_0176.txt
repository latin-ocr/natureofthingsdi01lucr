which Iphigenia was thus decoyed. Without hav-
ing any design of uniting himself with her, he never-
theless quarrels most vehemently with the whole synod
of Grecian chiefs, for thus presuming to employ his,
name on so base an occassion ; and advises, but un-
successfnlly, to set sail without offering so precious
a sacrifice.

Racine, on the contrary, has made Achilles a
most violent admirer of Iphigenia, and repre-
sents their marriage as on the point of being so-
lemnized, at the very moment when Calchas, the
priest‚ announces the fatal demand of Diana. He
represents, aisn, Iphigenia as resolved, at all adven-
tures, notwithstanding the delirious affection of
Achilles, and her own anterior vows of attachment,
to submit heroically to the doom decreed her: nor is
she to be deterred from self-consecration by the sighs
ofher mother, or the frantie declarations of the Gre-
cian chieftain‚ who threatens, if she suffer herself to
be thus destroyed, and the gods be panting for hu-
man blood, that he will immediately afterwards im-
molate the priest who is to sacrifice her, and even her
own father, by whose consent alone she is to suffer.
There is more rant, indeed, in this speech than Ra-
cine is in the habit of introducing :

Si de sang et de mortsle ciel est affamt':

Jamais de plus de sang ses autels n’ont flamme.
A mon aveugle amour tout sera legitime ς

Le pretre deviendra la premiere victime :

Le bacher, par mes mains detruit et renverse,
Dans le sang des bourreaux nagera disperse.

Et si, dans les horreurs dc ce desordre extreme,
Votre pere srappe tombe, et perit lui-meme,
Alors, de vos respects, voyant les tristes fruits,
Reconnoissez les coups que vous aurez conduits.

Such is the opposite and irreconcileable differencc
between the bombast of inflated and unnatural passion,
and the plain, unvarnished narration of Lucretius.
Achilles, however, in the Iphigenia of Racine, is
fortunately excused from committing this terrible car-

nage, by the well-known substitute of a deer: for,
as the victim is on the immediate point of being sa-
crificed, the priest becomes filled with a divine and
secret dread, the heavens are loaded with signs and
wonders, and this other and more pertinent victim is
instantly disclosed.

A tragedy on the same subject was written, a few
years afterwards, in mance, by Le Clerc, assisted
by his friend Coras. This dramatic composition ἶ
have never had an opportunity of reading 3 but either
its intrinsic merit was but small, or the envy of Racine
was very great on the occasion, since he gave himself
the trouble of writing the following epigram on its
appearance :

Entre Le Clerc et son ami Coras,

Deux grands auteurs, rimant de compagnie,
N’a pas long tems s’ourdirent grands debats

Sur le propos de leur Iphigenie.

Coras lui dit : “ La piece est de mon cru.''

Le Clerc repond: “ Elle est mienne‚et non votre.''
Mais aussitot que la piece eut paru,

Plus n'ont voulu l'avoir fait l'un, ni l'autre.

Le Clerc and Coras, who in partnetship rhym’d,
Iphigenia who wrote with such spirit,

When thedrarna was done,had a strife most ill-tim’d,
On deciding whose chief was the. merit.

⁴⁶ 'Tis all mine,’' said* Corasae—-st‘ To say so is

a frand,’'

Cried Le Clerc, “ for I wrote it myself.’'

But at length when the bantling was usher’d abroad,
Then neither would own the poor elf.

This story is as well calculated for painting as
for poetry ; and forms the subject of one of the best
pieces which has flowed from the pen of Sir Joshua
Reynolds: the colom-ing of which is after the Ve-
netian school, and exhibits oue of its happiest copieS.
Its rival, Jephtha's Vow, has been selected not less
frequently. Perhaps, the best picture from this latter
episode is Mr. Opie’s; but, like almost every prior
attempt, it is altogether ,spoiled by the painter’s
