Ver. 57. Far, sar from mortals, δια] It is much
doubted by some of the best commentators, whether
the six lines in the original, answering to the present
and five following verses, be not an interpolation, or,
at least, erroneously introduced by transcribers into
the present place. They, at least, discover a certain
want of connection with both the antecedent and suc-
ceedihg sentences. They are not, says ΜΓ. VVake-
field, to be found iu many copies both manuscript
and printed ; certainly not in the manuscript at Vc-
rona, nor in three other copies which Ι have collected
in this country. Bentley regarded thern as intro-
duced in this place unconnectedly‚ and without any
reference. And in the margin of the Cambridge
manuscript, some ancient annotator has written,
“ These six verses are transposed into this position
from Book II. not on the authority of the poet, but
It is on this
account they are included, in the original, in brackets ς

from the ignorance of his copyists.’'

a mark which is here, and in several other places, de-
signed to express a doubt.

They contain‚ however, the idea of ease and tran-
quillsty, which Homer had long before represented
as the common inheritance of the popular gods ; al-
though, according to the latter, this tranquillity was

sometimes interrupted by contests among themselves, ’
as well as by the daring obstinacy and opposition of

mankind : but, excepting in such casual instances of

mental commoti0n‚ they were Θεοὶ ῥεῖα ζωοντες, Dii

tranquilli viventes, or, as Mr. Pope expresses it,

Immortals blest with endless ease.
B. 6, v. 170.

A passage, the Greek of which Milton perhaps hadt

in his recollection‚ when he wrote in his Paradise

Lost,
Thou wilt bring me soon

 

To that new world of light and bliss, among
ii. 868.

Silius Italicus was impressed with the same idea ς,
and hence, iu deseribing the deity, says

The gods who live at ease.

Imperturbatzi placidus tenet otia mente.
Calm is his quiet, undisturb'd his mind.

The “immortal gods'’ of the Epicurean system
are, however, of a very different description from
those of the Greek and Roman populace, and are no
where in the poem before us represented as the crea·
tors of the world, or as objects of religious worship.
They appear, indeed, to be the very same order of
'existences as the ‘⁶ gods'’ of Milton, created and
blessed spirits, endowed with endless duration‚ and
possessed of far superior faculties to man. They are,
therefore, as different from the popular deities of
Greecc and Rome, as these last are from the christian
