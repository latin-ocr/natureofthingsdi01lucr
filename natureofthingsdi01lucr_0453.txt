BooK II. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 305

Varies, from things that varying dyes educe, 820

Black, white, or aught besides, and nought imports,

Change how it may, th’ existing hue, but sole

The diff ’rent figures whence those hues are rear'd:

Hence useless colours to the seeds of things,

From varying forms by varying frictions rous'd. 82
Since, too, no seeds defin'd with tints are stain’d

Defin'd alike, and every shape concurs

In all that springs, whate'er the hue evinc'd,

Whence Hows it, then, that every class alike

Reflects not every tincture ?—-whence that crows 8 30

Robe not in white from seeds that white create ἓ

Or that the downy swan, in black array’d,

Or hues as hideous, ne’er the sight appals ?

As thingS, moreo'er, to parts minute divide,
Th' anterior tincture fades. Thus fades away, 83 5
To dust impalpable reduc'd, the dye
Of gold refulgent: thus the TYRIAN woof,

the several organs of our senses, produce in us those and was employed by them, as will soon appear
different sensations which we have from the colours more at large, in the solution of all sensations
