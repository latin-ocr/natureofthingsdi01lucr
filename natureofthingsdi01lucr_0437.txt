THE NATURE OF THINGS.

289

Flies off impalpable through pores extreme,
Void of all union‚ and for life unfit.

Nor deem each animated tribe alone

Such laws avows—all nature feels their force.

For since the diff ’rence ’twixt created things

Is total, their primordial seeds in form

Must differ too : not that they ne'er commix

Of equal shape, but e'en when mixt that still,

From re—arrangement, the result is chang'd.

735

Nor only in their forms thus vary seeds

Primordial ; but, alike, in weight, and pow'r‚

In concomse, motion, intervening space,

And close connexion ; changes that define‚

Not men and brutes alone, but bound secure

740

From ocean earth, and earth from heav'n sublime.

But haste we, many a truth lies yet unsung

phrastus, and by others, Strato of Lampsacus, isa
‘valuable relic of ancient times, and gives us by much
the fullest account of any book whatsoeoer, of the
general philosophy of the Greeks upon this sub-
ject, and even proceeds so fax· as to develope their
mechanical use of colours in the arts of dyeing and
painting. It is more valuable on this latter account,
indeed, than on the former; for, in the former, the con-
fused and erroneous ideas ofthe Peripatetics are still in-
dulged in all their incomprehensibility. M. Ameilhon,
in his “ Researches into the Colours of the Ancients‚
and the Arts which are connected with then1,⁷' (See
Memoires de l’Institut Narional, au iv. tom. i.
Liter. et Beaux Arts,) does not appear to have been

Epicurus upon the philosophy of colours ε for, while
heis altogether silent upon the writings of Lucre-
tius, he gives the above-mentioned treatise all the
