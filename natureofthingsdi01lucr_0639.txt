THE NATURE OF THINGS.

And as we now, through long anterior time,

Look back indifferent on the PUNtc hosts

Thac threaten'd RoME, when, with the din oswen,

All shook tremendous heaven's high eope beneath,

And doubtful hung the scale which pow'r should sule

Earth, main, and mortals, with unrivall'd sway;

tude, and were punctilious in attending at their tern-
ples. The source of these superstitious practices
could not escape the eye of the founder of the Epi-
curean system. He had persuaded himself, that
death is the final close of the soul as well as of the
body; that, hereafter, there is nothing to be either
hoped for or apprehended: and that the present life
is a blessing which, terminate whenever it may, is
entitled to an habitual thanksgiving and gratitude.
Hence, all that remained to be done, the whole duty of
man, consisted in using life so as not to abuse it; in de-
voting it to the attainment of the greatest portion of
real and rational enjoyment3andin contemplating death
as t'he quiet and peaceful mansion ofeverlasting repose.
Exchange the word evm-lasting for temporary, and
the Christian may go hand in hand with him. And
hence the reflections and observations which follow,
though founded upon an erroneous crecd‚ so far as rc-
lates to the immortality of the soul, and a future ex-
istence, are, in other respects, of universal application,
and may be made subservierit to universal benefit‚ as
well as universal entertainment.’'

The passage of Lucretius, which has drawn forth
these observation‘s, is deduced from a similar one in

Epicurus. Laertius has inserted itin his tenth book ι
Συνεθιζε 32 σεαυτον ν το

ἓξ w'Thv abconctoqt‘a θαναῗος, ΟΘΕν ’γνῶσίς opor} μηδέ νὲνὲνὲ *ἸΓΡΟς
ημας τον θανατον. Cicero has likewise a paragraph to
the same effect. Tusc. Qiaest. l. i. Natura vero sic se
habet, ut quomodo, initium nobis rerum omnium
ortus noster offerat, sic exitum mors3 quae ut nihil

pertinuit ad nos ante ortum, sic nihil post mortem

pertinebit. In qno quid potest esse mali, cnm mors
nec ad vivos pertineat, nec ad mortuos? alteri nulli
sunt, alteros non attingit. ‘⁶ Thus nature has or-
dained it, that as our birth was, with respect to
us, the beginning of all things, so death will be the
destruction; and as death was nothing to us before
we were born, so neither will it be after we are dead.
What ill, then, can there be in death, since it apper-
tains neither to the dead nor the living; to those who

feel it not, or to those who exist not ?’'

with the din of war,

Mr. Wakefield conjectures that the verse, of which
this passage is a translation, has some reference to

the following line os Ennius preserved by Cicero, de
Orat. iii. 42.

Africa terribili tremuit horrida terra tumultu.

With the tremendous tumult shook the shores
Of shuddering Afric.

Ver. 861. And doubtful hung the scale whichpow’r
should rnle} Thus, Milton :

Th’ Eternal to prevent such horrid fray,

Hung forth in heav’n his golden scaleS, yet scen
Betwixt Astraea and the Scorpion sign,
Wherein all things created first he weigh’d,
The pendulons round earth with balanc’d air

In counterpoise, now ponders all events,

Battles and realms.

Pla. Losr, iv. 996.
