Boon ΙΙ,

First EARTH herself th' essential atoms holds

THE NATURE OF THINGS.

Of streams and fountains, whence the main renews3

Holds in herself the secret seeds of fires,

Oft the brown heath wide-parching, miperceiv'd,
And oft, like AEtna, blazing to the day:

And holds each embryon, whence, to glad mankind,

Springs the gay corn, the blossom’d fruit-tree springs,

Or whence the brutal tribes that roam at large

Draw their green banquets, and possess their shades.

Hence mighty MOTHER or TH' IMMoRTAL Gons,

Of brutes‚ and men, is EARTH full frequent feign'd.

the earlier ages of the post-diluvian world are divi-
sible into three classes, the arkite, the solar‚ and the
ophite. The first female divinity ever invented, was,
according to Mr. Bryant, a deification of the ark,
under the appellation of Isis, Aphrodite, or Venus 3
and from the circumstance of its containing, in its
womb, the whole existing world ofanimals—even the
patriarchs themselves, who were afterwards deified
and worshipped—this deity was denominated‚ in
Egypt, where the superstition took deepest root,
Da-Meter, Δημπτηρ, “ the mother of gods and men‚'’
the great first principle of all things. In the note
above referred to, I have observed, from the same
hypothesis, that she had two annual feasts appropria-
ted to her honour ; during which periods all her priests
assistedin a public exhibition and procession of a little
ark, typical of her original existence, and all the
people pressed forwaids to worship it ; and that the
greatest degree ofjuy and idolam-oua exultation pre-
vailed on these occasions. In process of time, how-
ever, as mankind descendet] from the period of the
flood, this important event became less deeply im-
pressed on their minds. They then behcla' all things

tions of their fabulous deities, and, consequendy,
that these deities themselves, primarily arose. On
the earth, as well as the ark, they now therefore con-
ferred the name of Da-Meter, or Δημητηρ, “ the com-
mon mother of all things;” gods and men, as well
as plants and animals; writing it, perhaps, origi-
nally, Γημητηρ, Ge-Meter, or “ Mother-earth,’' which,
by an easy convertibility, was tranferred into the very
title bestowed on Isis, or Aphrodite. Having thus
tranferred to the Earth the name or title originally
applied to Isis, they also instituted a similar system
of religious feastc, and this junior Da-Meter, or
deifie'd Γη, or Barth, had her own solemn proces-
