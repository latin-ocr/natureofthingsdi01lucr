62 DE RERUM NATURA. L12.1.

Confiteare esse in rebus, nec posse videri.
Principio, venti vis verberat incita pontum,
Ingenteisque ruit naveis, et nubila differt3
Interdum, rapido percurrens turbine, campos
’ Arboribus magnis sternit, monteisque supremos 275
Sylvifragis vexat flabris: ita perfurit acri
Cum fremitU, saevitque minaci murmure, pontus.
Sunt igitur venti nimirum corpora caeca,
Quae mare, quae terras, quae denique nubila coeli,

Verrunt, ac subito vexantia turbine raptant. 280

Qalis hyperboreis Aquilo curn densus ab oris

So Boreas in his race, when rushing forth,

Siveeps the dark skies, and clears the cloudy North:

The waving harvests bend beueath his blast‚

The forest shakes, the groves their honours cast.

He flies aloft, and, with impetuous roar,

Pursues the foaming surges to the shore.

Lucretius, in his turn, has been indebted to Homer.
The storm of wind he has here so admirably described,
and the storm of water to which he immediately after-

Thus from high hius the torrents swift and strong
Deluge whole fields, and sweep the trees along ;
Thro' ruined moles the rushing wave resounds,
O'erwhelms the bridge‚ and bursts the lofty bounds:
The yellow harvests of the ripen’d year,

And flatted vineyards one sad waste appear;
While Jove descends in sluicy sheets of rain,

And all the labours of mankind are vain. P

It is from Homer or Lucretius Ariosto has copied
his description of the same phenomenon. The de-
struction of the incumbent bridge‚ with several other
circumstances, occur alike in each of them. orl. Fur.

’ Per nieve scioha, e per montane piove,
E l’impeto de l'aqua havea disciolto,
E tratto seco il ponte, e il passo tolto.
