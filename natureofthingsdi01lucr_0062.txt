xlviii THE LIFE OF LUCRETIUS.

are so highly finished, contain such lively descriptiOnS, or are so
harmonious in their versification, as where our poet speaks of the
fruitfulness occasioned throughout all nature, by vernal ssiowers*; of
the ravages committed by tempestuous winds ; of the difficulty of his
undertaking, where, after mentioniug the great obscurity of his subject,
he breaks out into that enthusiastic rapture†· :

Obscure the subject: but the thirst of farne

Burns all my bosom ; and through ev’ry nerve

Darts the proud love of letters, and the muse.

Ι feel th' inspiring power; and roam resolv'd

Through paths PmmAN never trod before.

Sweet are the springing founts with nectar new;

Sweet the new flowers that bloom: but sweeter still

Those flowers to pluck, and weave a roseat wreath‚

The muses yet to mortals ne’er have deign'd.

‘⁶ The second book opens with a sublime description ofa true philo-
sopher, standing on the top of the temple of wisdom, and looking
down with pity and contempt on the busy Imm of men. This is followed
by a forcible exhortation to temperance of each kind, and by that
account of the pleasures of a country life‡‚ which Virgil has exactly
copied at the end of his second book of the Georgics. The fears and
the cares that infest human life are afterwards personified in the fol-
lowing mannergt

But ifall this be idle, if the efflas,

The TERRoRs still that haunt, and harass man,
Dread not the din of arms‚-—o'er kings and chiefs‚
Press unabash’d, unaw'd by glittering pomp,

The purple robe unheeding—

‘⁴ These images are surely far superior to those admired ones of

Horace :
