DE RERUM NATURA.

Quae tamen onmia corpore& constare necesse est

opposite principle, that vom, the precise converse of
soor, is possessed ofa nature free from touch, lib. 10.
The philosophy of the semes, however, is given with
so much beanty and precision in the fourth book of
this poem, that no commentar-y is necessary to him
who attentively peruses it.

ever, is as old as the book ofJob, in which the atten-

probability, that Lucretius has immediately derived
it ; of whom the hand of time has yet spared us the
following fragment :

Εκθαμινης ραθαμιγγος, οκως λογος, meu ιοισας,

By ceaseless drops, like eloquence, that flow,
The rigid stone is hollowed.

In general, however, Lucretius has been rather
imitated than an imitator. Thus Sulpicius:

Decidens scabrum cavat unda tophum ς
Ferreus vomer tenuatur agris
Splendet adtrito, digitos honorans,

Annulus auro.
