THE LIFE OF LUCRETIUS. lxxi

O that Ι knew where Ι might find him :—

Behold! I go forwards, but he is not there ;

And backwaffls, but Ι cannot perceive him ε

011 the left hand I feel for him, but trace him not,

⁴He enshroudeth the right hand, and I cannot see him 2⁸.

So, tho devout Asaph :

In the sea is thy way,
And thy path in the deep waters,
And thy footsteps are not known †.

And hence the Athenians, 111 future ages, erected an altar to this samev
inscrutable aud MYSTE 111ου3 Powmz. and inscribed it ΑΓΝΩΣΤῼ ΘΕῼ,
“ To THE UNKNOWN GOD.’' St. Paul remark-cd the inscription in his
visit to this city, and p211·tiotila1·ly alludes to it in his adtlress to the

Our common version of ver. 9, of this passage, is incorrectly rendered “on the left hand where he doth
work.'' The verb obviously refers to the speaker, and not to the Creator3 aud hence the Septuagint‚
more accu›1·ately‚ Αριστερα ποιησαντος αυτου. Yet, ποιησαντος does not give the full meaning of 'lflwy2‚

or rather, vfflssiyl which more precisely implies εψηλαφησα avec», ηφκπαμην ; and supposes a person to

be feeling for 311 object in total darkness, or with a bandage before his eyeS. Reiske is the only com-
mentator Ι have met with, who enters into the complete spirit of the passage, and he readers it, as I have
mysclf given it above, “ Ich hasche ibn, oder, ich gressbsnach ihmss’ The Arabians still preserve the
Hebrew term in the same sense : ’3ᾈῷ It is to this passage, andin this explanation of it, St.
Paul seems to refer, Acts, xvii. 27. “ Thai they should seek aster the Lord, if haply‚ whilefieling aster
blm, they might find him.'' Ειαρα ‘ydram φησιαν τιιντον xm ἑυροιεν.
The latter period of the verse is more etnphatically rendered, “ he enshroudeth the right hand‚'' or,
‘⁶ he wrappeth it up in darkness‚'' than “ he hideth himself‚” aud is a happy continuation of the figure
just introduced. The Hebrew term ηυγ, in its primary signification, refers to the garments by which
our limbs are covered or ‚concealeds-and hence, secoudarily, implics to ΑΜΖ», nzzgffle. or enshroud. In
this instance, the Spanish exposition of Luis de Leon gives us the true sense, though it fails in inter-
preting the former member of the verse. “ Si ti la izquierda, qne hare' Ρ no le asire‘ .· si ὰ la derecha vuelvo,
o le ver? ἃ ίΙ. O como el original ἰι la [εὴ-ιι .· Izquierda en obrar suyo, y no le otcrare' ; en cubrir derasae,- y
no le veri-'⁵
