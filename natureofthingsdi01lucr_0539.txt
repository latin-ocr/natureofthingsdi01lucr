so called, is a conception altogether modern: yet
few, even in modern days, embrace the conception
in a state of unmixed and perfect purity. Berkdey,
who denied the existence of a material and external
world, was, unquestionably, a proselyte to this be—
lies; for, if there be no such thing as matter, the
soul itsels cannot be material. Des Cartes was a
proselyte in an equal degree ς for he not only main-
tained the existence of the soul’s immateriality, but
denied that it had any one property in¹ common with
matter. The difficulties, however,.attendant upon
these two hypotheses, and which I have endeavoured
concisely to enumerate in the preceding life of our
poet, are so extreme, that I believe few are to be
found, in the present day, who profess them to their
utmost extent. Generally speaking, some degree of
materiality, such, at least, as will enable the soul to
assume a material configuration, or to be capable of
occasional vision to material organs, some phantasm,
shade, or shadowy appearance, some capacity for the
enjoyment of corporeal dehghts, however spiritua—
lized and refined, are uniformly supposed to attach
to it, even after its separation from the body. With
such, the soul is not strictly immaterial: it cannot
exist without an etherial or gaseous substratum, or
vehicle : in reality‚ it cannot exist in a state separate
from matter3 and the poet before us has no contest
with such persons otherwise than as to its powers of
durability or incorruption, concerning which a reve-
lation, posterior to his own era, has clearly ascer-
tained to us that he was mistaken; but which no-
thing but such a revelation could have ascertained.
Such persons may, therefore, peruse every argument
which the text discloses, without dismay3 they may
admit their truth, without shuddering sor the result:
since the result to which nature and the poet would
equally lead us, we now know to be subverted by a
law of inem-ruptim, communicatcd to us by the
Christian Scriptures.

Coe‘val with our poet, there were as few who had
a right to differ from him, so far as his principles ap-
plied, as there are in the present day. The gene-

rality of his contemporaries unqucstionably,as among
onrselves, believed in the soul's survival after the
dissolution of the body ; but they did not believe in
its survival as a spirit strictly immaterial, or in a state
of actual separation from matter. The soul con-
ceived of by the multitude was a compound sub-
stance, sometimes supposed to consist osa shade and
spirit, and sometimes of a ,rhoda spirit, and ghost,
to each of which a distinct and separate region was
allotted, as I have already observed in the note on
Book 1. v. 136: but each of which was, at the same
time, apprehended to be possessed ofa material confi-
guration, as well as organs, and subject to material
The soul of the philosophers,
notwithstanding all their boasting, waS, in reality,
as little exempt from matter, and as little capable ol'
a separate existence, as that of the people. Plato,
Aristotle, and Pythagoras, equally held the soul to
be a compound being, of which a part, at least, was
material. According to the opinion of the first, the
human soul consists of an emanation of the Deity‚
united to a portion of the material soul of the world ;

and on its separation from the body, it is still sur·-
rounded by an οχημα, or material vehicle, till the re-
sorption of the divine emanation into the divine na-
ture, and the return of its mundane elements to the
soul of the world, whence they issued.

In conse-

in a part of its constitution, but altogether incapable
of a separate existence, or existence per se, strictly so
called. The theory of Aristotle was not widely dif-
ferent ; and, with respect to Pythagoras, from whom
there can be no doubt that both Plato and Aristone
derived their ideas, he not only conceived the human
soul to be a compound of an immaterial mind, and of
sensitive matter, the former of which he denominated
φρην, and maintained tri be immortal ; and the latter
