Boox Ι,

And flame engend’ring. For could fire itself

THE NATURE OF THINGS.

A part constituent of the forest form,

No hour could hide the mischief ; ev'ry tree

Would blame, and burn till boundless ruin reign'd.

See, then, as earlier sung, how much imports

Th’ arrangement, motion, magnitude, and form

970

Of primal seeds combin'd : and how the same,

Transpos'd but little, fuel quick convert

To flame, bright blazing up the swarthy flue:

As FLUE and FUEL, terms of different sound,

Of different sense, their letters but transpos’d‚

975

Each into each converts with magic speed.

But should'st thou urge that all things still may How

From primal seeds, and yet those seeds possess

The form, the nature of the things themselves3

ligna and igneis, or wood and fire3 but as these, in
our own lauguage, by no means convey the poet’s
orthographic illustration, 1 have found it necessary
to introduce a slight change, which, in every re-
spect, answers and elucidates his intention. The
version of Evelyn and Creech, as well as that of
Guernier, who has followed the two former, retain
the Latin terme lignum and ignis, but with extreme
awkwardness in lines that pretend to give a trans-
lation. Marchetti has endeavoured to avoid this
evil; but, in his escape,¹ has introduced one quite
as considerable, by the adoption of terms, which,
though orthographically expressive of our poet’s in-
tention, have no kind of connexion with his metaphors.

E puono gli stessi variati alquanto
Far le legne e le flamme appunto come

Puongli gli elementi variati alquanto
Formare ed arme ed orme e rame e rome.

Coutures has been more unhappy than any of the
translators3 for without dai-ing, like Marchetti, to
introduce new tei-ms, he has given those of the oxi-

ginal literally translated into his own language,
where they make a more awkward‚ and inapposite
appearance than even the Latin terms preserved in
the three English versions. Rendered by Coutures,
the Latin lignum and ignis become bois andfeu ; but
by what means these words, which have not a
single letter in common, can be orthographically
transposed into each other, or how they can pos·
sibly explain the poet's meaning, it is not easy to
determine.
