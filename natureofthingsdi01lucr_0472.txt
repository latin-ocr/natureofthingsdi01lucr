DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. ΙΙ,

Principiom3 nequeunt ullius corporis esse

Sensus ante ipsam genitam naturam animantis:

Nimirum, quia materies disjecta tenetur

Aiire, fluminibus, terris, terraque creatis ;

Nec, congressa modo, vitaleis convenienteis

Contulit inter se motuS‚ quibus omne tuentes

Adcensei sensus animantum quamque tuentur.

Quam patitur natura, repente adfligit, et omneis

Et penitus motus vitales inpediuntur3

Donec materies, omneis concussa per artus,

V italeis animae nodos e corpore solvit,

Disparsamque foras per caulas e'icit omneis.

Nam quid praeterea facere ictum posse reamur

Oblatum, nisi discutere, ac dissolvere, quaeque?

Fit quoque, urei soleant, minus oblato acriter ictu,

Reliquiae motus vitalis vincere saepe3

himself, and consequently of our own poet, which
admits, that some such intercourse with superior
beings may be obtained by deep retirement, and men-
tal abstraction ; and, what is of far more importance
to me, by the clear and uuequivocal intimations of

revelation ε the Jewish and Christian scriptures both
equally presupposing the superintendant—e of indi-
viduass, of distinct churches, nations, and the world
at large, by spirits or angels expressly delegated to
their respective officeS. But I must leave the sub.
ject, which it would be, nevertheless, pleasant to
pursue. The reader may consult, if he chuse to
extend it farther, a German volume which has lately
been brought forwards, but 1 believe, not yet tmus-¹
