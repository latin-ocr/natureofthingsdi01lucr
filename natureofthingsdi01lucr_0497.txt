THE NATURE OF THINGS.

349

Air from aeri-al, from the dewy, dew :
T ill all-prolific Nature rears at length

To full perfection the vast frame of things,

1130

And the gorg'd system can no more absorb

Than what flies casual from th' external pores.

Then boasts the whole completion3 Nature, then,

Restrains all progress, every power matur’d.

For all with gradual growth that swells, and thus

1135

Climbs, by degrees, the scale of life adult,

Far less emits¹ than what its frasne receives.

Wide through the system flows the genial food

T ow’rds every part disperst: yet not so wide

That much transudes externaL

and the day 1 140

Thus loses larges than the day digests.

For still, though much evanish, ampler still

druse, allegor-leally‚ to attributethe names of Cybele,
or mother of the Gods, of Neptune, Jupiter, Apollo,
and Diana, to the different elementa and heavenly
bodies, they should still remember, that the whole is
fiction, and that, in themselves, these substances pos-
sess no sensation whatsoever. See ver. 663, and
following, of the present book. While he reminds
the philosophers more particularly, who, in different
modes, attached the idea of animatior] and divinity
to these material bodies, that, so far from being en·
titled to celestial honours, they

Full proof exhibit, rather, how devoid

Of vital action matter may exist :

And that not every compound frame alike
Boasts the high power of intcllect and mind.

He tells them, expressly, that it is only from a pe-
culiarly organized state of matter, sensatim, and

thought, can ever ensue 3 and that even these qualities
do not equally pervade the whole system, when thus
organized, but are rather confined to the bosom

alone. See Book V. v- 144.

Since e'en in body then the soul and mind
Are fixt thus definite, we amply prove
That out of body, and a reasoning frame
In putrid glebes of earth or solar fire

In air or water, sense can never dwell.
And hence these ne’er divinity can boam,
Since e’eu devoid of animated life.

When Lucretius, therefore, as in the present in-
stance‚ applies‚ to the general frame of the earth,
terms which more peculiarly belong to the frame of
animal life, it is obvious, that he only applies them
metaphorically: and that he means to describe her
as a systematis, but nota sentient being.
