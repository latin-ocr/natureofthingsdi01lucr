THE LIFE OF LUCRETIUS. xcvii

but finding that the party of Memmius, and the other candidates for
the still vacant consulate, were too powerful for this utmost gratifica—
tion of his ambition, he artfully lowered his p1·etensioiiS‚ and had inte—
rest enough to obtain the consulate for two dependents upon him, Do-
mitius Calvinus and Valerius Messala. This point being secui-ed, his
next object was to glut his vengeance upon those who had prccluded
him from beeoming dictator: Caius hlemnnius, and various others,
were hence arraigned at his instigation before the comitia, upon the=

in the year of the city 701, and towards the close of that year, the date we are furnished with precisely
coincides with that offered by the Chronicle of Eusebius, which states Lucretius to have been forty-four
years old at the time of his death. Cicero, as 1 have already observed, in his letters to Atticus, vii. 24· 25,
speaks of a Lucretius, a bosom friend of Cassius, who was resident at Capua, at the time when the sc-
nate fled from it, along with Pompey’s army, at the approach of Caesar; and who repeatcdly communicate&
