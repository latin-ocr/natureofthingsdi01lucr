Boox Ι. THE NATURE oF THINGS. 97

Were matter not eternal, ages since
All had return’d to nothing whence it sprang‚ 595
And from that nothing all again reviv’d.
But since from nothing nought can ever rise,
As prov'd above, nor aught to nothing shrink,
Seeds there must be of ever-during date,
To which, perpetual, things dissolve, or whence 600
Flows the fresh pabulum that all repairs.
But seeds thus simple must be solid too;
Else unpreserv’d through countless ages past,
And useless to recruit th’ exhausted world.
Else friction, too, had injur'd ε each by each 605
Through myriad years abraded, and reduc’d,
'Till nought conceptible had liv'd to rear,
Each in its time, the progenies of earth τ

And hence, had all been thus disturb'd, dissolv’d, 610
And fritter'd through the long anterior lapse

Of countless ages, fisture time in vain
