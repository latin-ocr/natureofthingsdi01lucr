Nec minus ille diu jam non erit, ex hodierno

DE RERUM NATURA.

[ΑΒ. ΙΙῘ.

Lumine qui finem vitai· fecit, et ille,

Mensibus atque annis qui multis obeidit ante.

Ver. 1133. ‘To him who yesterday the light forsook,

Thau him who died-full many (ι yem- bifora]
In the note on ver. 1076, Ι bave given an instance of
Dryden’s version of a few lines of Lucretius, which
were afterwards adopted by Pope in his translation
of the Iliad. I have now to offei- another instance
of similar fosterage and intertexture. The passage
before us is thus rendered by Dryden:

When once the Fates have cut the mortal
thread,

The man as much to all intents is dead,

Who dies to-day‚ and will as long be so,

As he who died a thousand years ago.

In the Essay on Man, they occur thus, in a con-
verse form, obviously introduced from Dryden‘s pa-
raphrase; for Lucretius says nothing of ‘⁴ a thousand
years.''

The blest to-day is as completely so
As who began a thousand years ago. ΕΡ. i.

Jortin has some Latin verses of such singular ele-
gance and pathos, and so appropriate with the
grand idea conveyed in the last five verses of this
hook, that I cannot possibly avoid copying· and
translating them: they are a free imitation of the
exquisite epitaph of Moschus upon Bion, which I

have already given in the note on v. 937.

Hei mihi! lege rata sol occidit atque resurgit,

Lunaque mutatae reparat dispendia formae :

Sidera, purpurei telis extincta diei,

Rursus nocte vigent z humiles telluris alumni,

Graminis herba virens, et florum picta propago,

Qos crudelis hyems lethali tabe peredit ;

Cum Zephyri vox blanda vocat, rediitque se-
renl

Temperies anni, redivivo e cespite surgunt.

Nos, Domini rerum! nos, magna ct pulchra mi-
nati !

Cum breve ver vitae, robustaque transiit aestas,

Deficimus ; neque nos ordo revolubilis amas

Reddit in aetherias, tumuli nec claustra resolvit,

By punctual laws the sun ascends, and sets;

The waning moon new majesty begets3

Slain by the jav’lins of the purple day,

The stars revive at midnight : every spray,

Each blade of grass, the pictur’d race of flowers,

That, with fierce phang, the wint’ry wind de-
vours,

When Spring returns, at Zephyr's kindling

voice,

Peep from the greensward, and again rejoice.

We, lords of all ! we, big with bold emprize!

When once the spring, the flower of mnnhood
flies,
