THE NA'I'URE OF THINGS.

She survey’d

Near her, her sad, sad sire ; th' officious priests

Repentant half, and hiding their keen steel,

throwing a veil over the eyes of the young and
beautiful oblation‚ by which half her charms, and
more than half t-he effect of the subject, is nnmer-
cifully destroyed. Among the Greeks there was
a most celebrated picture from the tale of Iphigenia,
by Timantes, of which Cicero has given us a par-
ticular description. Chalcas, Ulysses, Menelaus,
and several other personages, were introduced into the
scenery‚ with countenances of great grief and com—
miseration. The painter, having thus exhausted his
art, was at a loss how to express the superior
agony of the father3 and, with a stratagem somewhat
similar to the above, concerning which he has been
often complimented, but the idea of which was ob-
viously borrowed from Euripedes, he threw a veil
carelessly over his face3 “quoniam,'' as Cicero
has elegantly expressed it, “ summum illum luctum
“ pencillo non posset imitari.” In Orat.—“ Be-
“ cause no art of the pencil could delineate the ex-
“ treme grief he endured.'' These tricks of the
profession are, in my apprehension, at all times be-
'neath the dignity of a man of real genius; and be-
speak povertyiof imagination rather than modesty
in the artist.

must inform the English reader, that the term
propter in the original may be translated either as a
preposition of matrive, or of place ; or, in other words,
that the version may be rendered—“ She perceived
⁸⁶ the priests conceal the knife near her father‚'’ or
‘¹ on account qs her father.'’ Evelyn, and Creech
who has closely copied him, have both pretended
to descry a peculiar degree of force and emphasis
in the last lection 3—in the concealment of the knise
on account ‘ff the father. 1 have chosen to consider
the preposition, however, as referring to place alone,
independently of motive5 and that sor the following

reasons: ist, It is Iphigenia herself, and not her
father, who stands ‘most advanced in the fore-ground
of this elegant groupe. She is in every respect the first
figure, and he but a second. The poet, true to the
feelings of nature, delineates her as fully sensible of
the blessings of life, as well as of youth, and the horu
ror of the doom to which she is devoted,——and de,
voted too by her father's consent. He has amasset]
together, in the most exquisite and pathetic coloni-s,
every circumstance that can tend to depict theragony
of her mind, and excite the compassion Of the
crowd around her. The people pity her 3 her father
pities her; the priests pity her z and while they con-
ceal the sacrificing knife

 

on whose account do the)
conceal it? Doubtless on her own—Nem the fa-
ther, but οη account of the daughter. To read the
passage otherwise is to destroy half the spirit of the
episode. The version of Evelyn and Creech may
apply to the tale as related by Euripides, but not as
related by Lucretius.

But, zdly, all our best annotators‚ translators and
expositors, have adopted this very interpretation 01
the preposition which I have given myself. Th<
verb that follows ought, I think, to be celare3 and.
following the greater number of copieS‚ Ι have so
rendered it in the translation. In the edition of Gif-
sanius, however, in that of Bologna, and in that of
Mr. Wakefield, as printed on the opposite page, it
is celerare, ‘¹ to brandish,” instead of “ to conceal.'’
But those who prefer celerare, must necessarily use
propter in the sense offered in the text3 for, ‘⁶ tu
“ brandish the knife because of the father,” would
be nonsense. Contures who, with myseff, has re-
tained celare, has also retained propter in my own sig-
nification. “ Elle vit,’' says he, “son pere devant
‘⁴ l’autel, elle s’appergut que les ministres qui etoient
‘⁴ proches de lm', cachoient le coteau sacr6.'' Pre-
cisely to the same effect is the elegant version of Mar-
chetti, who is the only poet, in any nation‚ by whom

Lucretius has hitherto been worthily translated.
