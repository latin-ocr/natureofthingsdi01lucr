THE NATURE OF THINGS. 31

Thus spreading sense where sense was none before.

Nor deem sensation senseless seeds create

Sole from some change anterior, long educ'd

Ere into birth the sentient being springs.

What more fallacious ? since nor birth complete

950

Nor aught of change can Nature's self create

But from the sympathy of primal seeds:

 

the male the female; and this with the nicest dis-
crimination of their specific powers of crassitude or
tenuity, and consequently of reciprocal adaptation,
without which no vital entity would ensue. So
much imports it in the beautiful language of our

poet, Book IV. ¹3²0·
that the seeds of life

With seeds should mix symphoneous‚ that the

 

gross
Condense the rare, the rare the gross dilute.

Let us mount still higher, and we shall perceive
in the animal kingdom, even in man himself, that a
variety of substances possess a kind of idiopathetic
influence over some member or organ of the corporeal
frame, which they never exert, or at least in a
subordinate degree over every other. Alcohol has
a specific connexion with the liver3 turpentine with
the kidnies; cantharides with the neck of the uri-
nary bladder3 jalap with the intestinal canal, opi-
um and peruvian burk with the whole nervous sys-
tem; the former diminishing sensation, and the
latter preventing the recurrence of the spasm of in-
termittent fevers-

In a manner somewhat similar, one member or or-
gan of the percipient frame appears to possess a spe-
cies of intimacy or connexion with some other mem-
ber or organ, though considerably remote from it-
self, which it does not discover towards the system
at large. Thus, physicians trace a sy1np2thy be-
tween the liver and the left shoulder, which is said
to be frequently possessed of pecnliar uneasiness du·
ring a decay of the former. The same kind of sym-

pathy subsists between the head and the stomach ;--
between the stomach and the external capillary ves-
sels; and between these, and the glands of the kid-
nies: an affection of the one producing generally an
affection of the other, and vice versit.

The same kind of inexplicable sympathy may.
perhaps, subsist between mind and mind, even al·
lowing the mind itself to be material. And the
view I have just taken of the natural world will, in
some measure, unfold to us, Ι think, the cause of
that species of moral affection, which has been ter-med
pure, or platonic love, an elective attraction of mind
to mind, which has been often denied by philoso-
phers, and ridiculed by wits, and in many cases
mostjustly, but which, if I mistake not, these ob-
servations seem to prove, may have a real foundation
in nature. How mind operates upon mind we know
not: into sensible contact it can never come: but
neither does the sun or the moon in their operatione
upon the earth. The operation of motives and ar-
guments is along and circuitous mode of exciting
reciprocity of affection: and it will often be found
at last, that the affection thus produced, is of far
inferior force, and indeed, of a nature altogether
different from that excited by a certain indescribable
sympathy, which sometimes compels the soul to
feel more pleased with a person of less intellectual,
and perhaps, even moral worth, than with another
person whose endowments are confessedly superior.
This view of the subject may be carried still further,
and affertis some foundation for the belief of an oc-
easional intercourse between oin-selves and the spirite
