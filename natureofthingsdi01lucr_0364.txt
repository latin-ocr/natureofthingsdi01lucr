DE RERUM NATURA.

Lus. ΙΙ.

In terras igitur quoque solis vergitur ardor.

Transvorsosque volare per imbreis fulmina cernis ι

Nunc heic, nunc illic, abruptei nubibus, ignes

Concursant ; cadit in terras vis flammea volgo.

Illud in hiis quoque te rebus cognoscere avemus:

Corpora, quom deorsum rectum, per inane, feruntur,

Ponderibus propriis incerto tempore ferme,

Incertisque locis, spatio depellere paullum :

Tantum, quod minumum mutatum dicere possis.

Ver. ΖΙ 7. And sows thefields with light —:] In

the same manner, our unrivalled Milton :

Now mom, her rosy steps in th' eastern clime
Advancing‚ sowed the eard] with orient pearl.
PAR. Losr, b. v. ver. 1.

Gesner has caught the same metaphor, and has
frequently introduced it into his Death of Abel.
Thus, in book i. Die unstergehende sonne streute
unausprechlichen glanz iiber sie hin. “The de-
scending sun sowed ineffzble lustre all over it.'' The
bold, and beautiful language of the Psalmist‚ eon-
taius, in many places, a similar image. Thus, xcvii.

Light 1's sowa on the righteous,
And gladness on the upright of-heart.

But, perhaps, the most daring use of this figure,
at least in modern times, occurs in the eclogues of
Garcilago de la Vega ι

Aves ! que aqui sembraIs vuestras querellas!

Birds ! in these woodsyour soft complaints who saw !

Ver. 2 17. —and the dread flash,
When thunder rendr the skics, though ‘wide it dart,]

Nothing can be more natural or more beautiful
than this short description of a thunder-storm. That
ofThomson, which immediately precedes his episode
os Celadon and A‘melia, has been much, and de-
servedly admired. I¹ insert, therefore, the parallel
passage, for a comparison with Lucretius z

Wde rent, the clouds
Pour a wholeflood, and yet, its flame unquench’d,
Th‘ unconquerable lightning struggles through,
Ragged and fierce, or in red whirling balls,
Andfires the mountains with redoubled rage.
SUMMER, 1145.

Ercilla is equally natural and picturesque. He
has obviously copied from Lucretius, and with a

master-ly hand z

Agna rezia, gramm, piedra espessa
Las intrica das nuves despendian,
Rayos, huenos, relampagos apriessa
Rompw los ciclos y la tierra abrian.
ARAUCAN. Cant. ix-

From clashing clouds their mingl'd torrents gush,
And rain and hail with rival fury rusb,-
