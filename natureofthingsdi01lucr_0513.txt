THE NATURE OF THINGS.

Weighs, with the present, the fair times elaps’d,

Envies the lot the men of yore enjoy'd.

Then, luckless plantet of degenerate vines!

ι His day he curses, then all heav'n he thes,

Mutt’ring that earlier times, though virtuous more,

should, thus, have more been favour'dff-thus have rear'd

An ampler harvest e'en from narrower fa1·ms,——

Heedless that all things by degrees must fail,

&Vorn out by age, and doom'd to certain death.

ten, that in almost every printed edition, the editor, not
being able to comprehend their meaning, has omitted
them «altogether. For this reason, they are not to
be found in any translation that I have ever met with,

either English or foreign. Heinsius contends‚ they
should be given thus: Lib. III. cap. 8.

Tristis item vetulae vitis sator, atque vietae,
Temporis, incusat nomen, seclumque fatigat.

Then luckless planter of degenerate vines
The world he tires, and his own name abhors.

Mr. Wakefield¹s lection, the reader will perceive,
is as follows ε

Tristis, item, vetulae vitis sator, (acta peragrans)
Temporis, incusat numen, caelumque fatigat.

In the translation I have relinquished, however,
the phrase, acta peragrans, “ contemplating the past,’'
as not existing in the generality of the best editions
and manuscript copies ; but I have admitted the in-
genious reading, and, in my opinion, very valuable

emendation of numen for nomen, and coelum for seclum,
inserted into the present edition of the original,
upon the authority of many ancient copies.

The entire passage cannot, perhaps, but remind
many of my readers of Hesiod’s description of the
fifth age of the world:

Mum-² ενι-εντ’ ωφειλον εγω πεμπτοισι μετεινοιι
Ανδρασιν, αλλ’ η 'ti-poe& θανειν, η επεττει γενεσθαι.
Νυν ’γαρ δη γενος εστι σιὲηριον· ουδεποτ’ ημαιρ
ssavo-ouran κωματου καί οιζυος, ηυδε τι vum-my,
ΦΘειρομενοι· χαλεπας δε Θεοι Samum μεριμνας.
Ona. et D1m.1. ι·

Ο ! might I ne’er this fifth rude age survey,
Posterior born, or hurried first away :

This age ofiron toil‚ degenerate grown,
VVhere night and day man lives but to bemoan,

Fruitless to labour‚ and to sweat, in vain—
For such th’ enormous ills the sates ordain.
