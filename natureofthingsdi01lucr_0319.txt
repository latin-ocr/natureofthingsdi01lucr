THE NATURE OF THINGS.

In idle hour, to minds perverse and vain.

KVhere all is infinite, What spot precise

Can e'er be central ? or were centre own’d,

Why towards such spot should matter rather tend,
Than elsewhere more remote, and deeper' still?
For vacant space, through every part alike,
Central! or not, must yield to things compact,
And pond'rous, as their varying Weight compels3
Nor through the boundless vom one point exists

Where things may rest, as if of Weight depriv'd.

No power- it boasts t' uphold3

but still recedes,

As nature prompts, and opes the needed path.

Hence, by the love alone of centre struck,

Th’ harmonious frame of things could ne'er be form’d.

prisoned even so late as the days of Milton, who vi-
sitcd him in his confinement: his works were pub-
licly bui-nt, and he was at length only released upon
making a public recantation, and submitting to the
penance of repeating once a week, for three years,
the seven penitential psaltns. Virgilius, bishop of
Saltzburg, during the papacy of Zacliaiy, was re-
duced to the same dilemma3 and when Boniface,
archbishop of Mentz, accused him of maintaining
the erroneous and blasphemous doctrine of the an-
tipodes, this enlightened head of the church or-
dained, that if he should be convicted of holding
so abominable an error, which he had uttered
against the Lord, and against his own smil, that
there are other worlds, other men under the earth,
other suns, and other moonS, a consistory immedi-
ately be convened3 that he be degraded from the
honour ofthe priesthood‚and be excommunicated from

the church. It was, indeed, the same principle
that condemned, in our own country, that first, and
most indefatigable philosopher ofhis age, Roger Ba-
con‚ to an imprisonment for ten years; his chemical
discoveries being attributed to dealings with the
Devil. During the zenith of the papal power, there
are but few instances to be traced of a successful op-
position to such frivolous and superstitious tenets as
philosophy then exhibited: but I ought not to for-
get that of Ferdinand of Spain, who, on the offer
of Colvirnbus to engage in a voyage into the south-
ern heinisphere in quest of the antipodes, instead of
imprisoning him for heresy of doctrine, although
opposed by the decrees of the church, by the opi-
nion of the Christian fathers, and of all his own ec-
clesiastical councillors, adopted the belief of the en-
terpi-ising navigator, and shortly afterwards reaped an
ample reward sor his liberality and strength of mind.
