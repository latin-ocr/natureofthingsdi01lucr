THE LIFE OF LUCRETlUs. lvii

known, that both in his diet and his 11101·ality‚as well as in his philosophie
doctrines, hc was a close and undeviating disciple of the Grecian suge.
Yes, they were lovers of PLnASURE-—and Luxu mous at their nicals:
they both confess the charge. But what was the pleasure os which
they were lovers, and the meals in which they indulged so luxu<
riously ? Cassius himself, and in the very words of Epicurus, shall tcll us,
as 116 told Cicero in an expostulatory letter he wrote to him, after hav>-
ing heard that Cicero had favoured the circulation of such aspersions.
Tho declaration of Cassius, moreover, is entitled to the utinost credit,
from his having intimately studied the life and doctrines ol' Epicurus z
and, as I have already related, been first a fellow-studcnt with both
Cicero and Lucretius, and afterwards an intimate and confidential
friend. “ Those,'’ says he, “ whom we call lovers of humum, are
real lovers of GoonNssss and JUSTICE: they are nien, who practise
and cultivate every virtue: for no true pleasure can exist, without a
good and virtuous life ᾗ. W'hen we assert theu, that Pamisum: is the
chief good, the prime felicity of man, we do not mean the pleasures
of the luxurious and the libidinous: the pleasures of the tastc‚ the
touch, or any of the grosser senses, as the ignorant, ον those wlco wil-
fully mistalce οιιν opiniom, maliciously assert: but what constitutes plea-
51116 with us is the possession osa body exempt from pain, and a mind
devoid of perturbation. It 15 not the company of the lascivious, nor
the luxurious tables of the wealthy, nor an indulgence 111 any sensual
dethts, that can make life happy; but itis a sound and unerring

* Ii qui a nobis φιληδονοι vocantur, sunt Φιλοκαιλοι και φιλοδικαιοι, omnesque virtutes et colunt, et retinent:
ov γαρ εστιν ilem ανευ του καλως και &mmm ζην, 816. Malbranche asserted the very same proposition, and
was misunderstood in the same manner. “ Tout plaisir‚’' said he, “ estun bien, et rend actuellement
heureux celui qui le goute.'' Nouveau Systeme de la Nature et de la Grace. This declaration was con·
ceived to be impious and immoral ; and it was soon vehemently attacked, in a publication entitled‚ “ Re-
flexions Philosophiques‚ et Theologiques sur le nouveau Systcme‚” &c. It was necessary, therefore, to
explain the meaning of Malbranche ; and we hence find it developed, in almost the words of Cassius, in a
periodical publication of much repnte in his own day. “ Tout plaisir est un bien : mais qui est ce que

c’est le plaisir ?—-c’cst la verm, c’est la grace, c’est l'amour de Dieu, ou plutot‚ c'est Dieu seul qui est
notre beatitude.” Nouvelles de la Republique des Lettres. Mois de Decembre, 1635.
