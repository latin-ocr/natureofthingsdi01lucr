Boon Ι. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 101

Hence matter too, through all its prima] seedS‚

Is prov’d immutable: for, if o’ercome

By aught of foreign force, those seeds could change, 64o
-All wonid be doubtful 3 nor the mind conceive

What might exist, or what might never live:

Nor why, decide, such variance in their powers,

And final terms of life, or instinct strong,

Through every age, still urging every race 645
To each pursust, each action of* their sires.

Know, too, each seed, each substance is compos'd

Of points extreme no sense can e'er detect τ

Points' that, perforce, minutest of themselveS,

To parts can ne’er divide: not self—educ'd‚ 6 5o
Nor, but as form'd‚ existing, else destroy’d.

Parts such can hold not 2> each the first, pure part,

Itself‚ of other substance z which, when join'd

Alone by kindred parts, in order due,

F ormS‚ from such juncti-on, the prime seeds of things. 655

But e'en such parts, though by the mind as parts
Conceiv’d, disjoin'd can ne’er exist3 and thence
Adhere by firm, indissoluble bond.

Fortes creantur fortibus et bonis ε Nor can the dove, with timid wings,

Est in juvencis, est in equis patrum Rise from the ravenous eagle's seed.
Virtus ε nec imbellem feroces
Progenerant aquilae columbam. On. iv, 4. Ver. 647. szw, too, each seed, each substance i„
From brave and good the good man springs; compos’d] See on this subject the note on

The horse, the heifer show their breed: ver. 53 5 of the present book.
