DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. 111·

Aut etiam venti, si fert ita forte voluntas,

N ec prorsum quidquam nostrae rationis egere;

45

Hinc licet advortas animum, magis omnia laudis,

Jactari caussam, quam quod res ipsa probetur:

Extorres iidem patria, longeque fugatei

Conspectu ex hominum, fedatei crimine turpi,

Omnibus aerumnis adfectei denique, vivunt3

50

Et, quoquomque tamen miserei venere, parentant,

Et nigras mactant pecudes, et manibus divis

Inferias mittunt3 multoque in rebus acerbis

Acrius advortunt animos ad religionem.

Quo magis in dubiis hominem spectare periclis

55

Convenit, advorsisque in rebus noscere, quid sit:

Nam verae voces tum demum pectore ab imo

ἔχ’

Ver. 47. Or, {f the humour urge them, is but air,]
The corresponding line in the original is as follows:

Aut etiam venti, si fert ita forte voluntas.

In the common editions, this line is placed two lower
than in the present, being v. 46, instead of v. 44,
where it lias remained sor ages a stumbling-block
to the ingenuity of every commentator who has en-
deavoured, in that situation, to give it a meaning.
For its present change, the reader is indebted to a
critic ofconsnmmate jndgment, whose name and act
are thus noticed by Mr. Wakefield: “ The idea of
this valuable transposition, which cannot be estima-
tcd too highly, is due alone to the sagacity of Bent-
ley, and is well worthy os such sagacity. How
would Lucretius hail him sor it! How happily are
the idle comments of former interpreters surrendered
hereby in a moment to darkness and oblivion Ψ

On the doctrine, that the soul originates from air,
or affriul auraS, see the ensuing note on v. ico.

Ver. 53. —fill new victims, and th' irfirnal powers
Implore with black oblations ‚·] The sacrifices
offered to the infernal deities, or manes of deceased
persons, to obtain their favour, were denominated
inferiae, and were always selected ofa black colour-
Hence Virgil, in the tale of Aristaeus:

Inferias Orphei lethaea papavera mittes,

Placatam Eurydicen vitula venerabere caesa,

Et nigram mactabis ovem, Geoxe. iv. v. 545.
To Orpheus deadly poppies strew, appense
With heifer slain, and blacl· devoted sheep
Eurydice's vext spirit.

This practice of offering sacrifices, both to the su-
perior and inferior gods, has been common in every
country that has acknowledged the existence ofa good
and evil principle ; whether these principles have con-
sisted of two, or of a greater number of deities ε to the
former sacrifice, the people being urged by gratitudo,
to the latter by sear. Such was the practice among
