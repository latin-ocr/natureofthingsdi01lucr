THE LIFE OF LUCRETIUS. lxxxi

the subsidence of the wate-s, and the diselosure of the dry land. IIe,
without difficulty, ean conceive, still pursuing the order of the sacred
historian, which is in every respect analogous with that of the Epicu-
rean system ἧς, and he is supported in such conception by the best prin—
ciples of ornithology,-·that, the suminits of the priinary mountains be-
ing covered with the verdure of the grassy herb, as the waters pro-
gressively retreated the atmosphcre was next inhahited ς aud that
the different genera os birds—many of which hare long since become
extimet, and perhaps existed but for a short period from the date of
the general ereati0u‚ but whose skeletous are still occasionally detected

soon as they began to he disclosed, and to be furnished with herbaceous
food, being the only animals, exceptiug fishes, which hitherto pos—
sessed a habitation. lt follows of necessity, therefore, as stated in
the sacred writingS, and as is expressly affirmed in the poem before
usffls, that terrestrial animals must have had a posterior creation, the
surface of the earth now gradually assuming a inore solid and exten-
sive appearance, and accommodating them withan augmenting theatre
of existence. The Mosaic account, indeed, limits this process to a
period in which, if the terms be understood in their strict and literal
sense, the existing phaenomena of nature seem to evince they could
not possibly have occurred ; for it confines the entire work of creation
within the compass of sili* (lays. In other parts of the scripturos, how-
ever, we have undeniable proofs, that the term dags, instead of being
restrained to a single revolution of the earth around its axis, is used,
in a looser and more general sense, for a definite, indeed, but a much
more extensive period3 and we have as ample a proof from the book
of nature, the existing face of the earth, that the six days or periods of
creation referred to, in the Mosaie cosmology, imply epoehs of much
greater duration than so many diurnal revolutions, as we have, in the
