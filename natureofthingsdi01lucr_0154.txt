6 DE RERUM NATURA.

L1n.1.

Quae mare navigerum, quae terras frugiferenteis,

Concelebras ; per te quoniam genus omne animantum

is creditable to the consistency of that mythology it-
self. But, surely, Lucretius was not to relinquilh a
beauty of this description, merely because it coincided
with the popular saith of his countrymen‚ or might
even be founded upon it. In my mind, it was an
additional motive for his having recourse to it; and
nothing can, in a greater degree, demonstrate the de-
licacy of his taste‚ or the correctness of his judgment.
lt is true, he is commencing a poetical essay, with
the express purpose of confuting the popular mytho-
logy of both Greece and Rome. He asserts repeat-
edly that the whole system is fictitious, and totally un-
worthy of credit3 but he asserts at the same time,
that so long as it is regarded as merc fiction, no evil
can ensue, and that its beauties are numerous and
apposite ε
Call, if thou chuse it, the resounding deep
ΝΕΡτυΝε, and Ceus term the golden grain,
Be BAccHus wine, its vulgar source forgot,
And e’en this globe of senseless EARTn define
Pium or Gons : no harm ensues; but mark,
’Tis fiction all, by vital facts disprov’d.
NAT. or Trunca, B. ii. 666.

The address, therefore, introduced at the com-
mencement of this poem, is pure, appropriate allegory,
deriving a high degree of beauty from its relation to
the popular mythology of the times. Surcly, the
Abbe St. Pierre must have totally forgotten this, and
fifty other passages of a similar tendency‚ when he
thus hastily cxpressed himself: “ Je n'en dirai pas
“ d’avantage sur ce poete 3 l'exorde de son poeme en
‘⁶ est la refutation.’'

The Portuguese poet cambas, than whom no man
was ever better acquainted with classical literature, has
followed Lucretius in a great part of this very alle-
gory, as he has also in a variety of other ,conceptions,
and in the present instance with peculiar felicity.
The deity chiefly introduced into the Lusiad is the
Urania—Venus, or heavenly Love of the ancients.
Gama, the hero of the piece, is thwarted in his voyage
of discovery towards India, by the devices of Bacchus,
the chiefdemon of that country, who, as the voyagers

advance towards the Indian highlands, flies with all
speed to Neptune, and intreats him to raise a tem-
pest and shivareck them on the very point of com-
pleting their enterprize. The whole is exquisitely
delineated. Neptune consents; and the gods of the
winds are ordered into immediate action. The storm
commences 3 and its description is perhaps unrivalled.
The terrified adventurers are in the utmost danger,
and expect every instant to perish. Gama addresses
himself to the Almighty, the God of the Christian
church, to him who was formerly the refuge of-Israel
in passing through the Red Sea, and of St. Paul in
sailing over ‘⁶ the sandy syrtes ofthe faithless waves.'’
The chieftain’s prayer is heard: the star of love
(amorosa esti-ella) is discovered in the horizon, pre-
lusive of the approach of Venus herself, who im-
mediately appears, and, in consistency with the power
assigned her by Lucretius, averts the impending de-
struction, puts to flight the winds and the tempests,
and restores to the world, peace, serenity‚ and gladness.
Mas ja a amorosa estrella scintillam,
Diante do sol claro orizonte,
Mensageira do dia, e visitava
A terra, e o largo mar con ledo fronte;
Venus que nos ceos a governava, &c.
When now the silver star of Love appear'd ;
Bright in the east her radiant front {he rear’d ς
Fair through the horrid storm the gentle ray
Announc’d the promise of the cheerful day;
From her bright throne celestial Love beheld
The tempest burn, and blast on blast impell’d:
Her lovely nymphs she calls, the nymphs obey ς
Her nymphs, the virtues who confess her sway 3
Round every brow she bids the rose-Euds twine,
And every flower adown their locks to stunc.—
Bright as a starry band the Nereids ssione,
Instant old Eolns' sons their presence own ;
T he winds die fizintly, and 2⁸71 sqflest s1'ghs
Each at hissair one's fiet desponding lirs. MJCKLE·
Since writing the above, Ι have looked into the
Spanish commentary of Manuel de Faria i Sonsa,
where I find the same conjecture advanced, that the
