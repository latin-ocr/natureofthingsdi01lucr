losophy of Epicurus was the most rational, and enforced the best prin.-
ciples of any system of philosophy recorded by prophane writers.

The doctrines of this system, however, were from time to time dis-
puted by other schools: and the contest appears for a long while to
have been conducted with no small equality between the disciples of
Epicurus, Aristotle, Zeno, and Plato; each sect, in its turn, prevail-

The chair of Epicurus was filled upon his death by Hermachus, one
of his most confidential friends and followers, whom by his will he ap-

for this office. The Epicureans of chief estimation besides himself,
anterior to the aera of Lucretius, were, Metrodorus, Polyaenus, Poly-
stratus, Dionysius, Basilides, Apollodorus, Protarchus, Phaedrus, and
Zen0; of whom the last two, as I have already observed, were joint re-
sidents and professors at the Epicurean estahlishment, when Lucretius,

and his co-students, were committed to it for education. Ι have already
mentioned the names of a great variety of characters of the first rank

and celebrity, who professed Epicurism at the time in which Lucre-
tius flourished; to these may be added, Trebasius, Piso, Albutius,
Pansa, and Pati-0, who was recommended to the protection of Caius
Memmius by Cicero himself& Even at this period, therefore, the
Epicurean school appears to have enjoyed a complete triumph at
Rome over every rival institute: nor could it fail of doing so, from the
conjoint exertions in its favour of such characters and scholars as At- ,
ticus, Cassius, Velleius, Memmius, and Lueretius. Even in the Au-

gustan age, it seems still to have retained, if not to have increased, its
