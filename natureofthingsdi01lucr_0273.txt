Boon Ι,

ΤΗΕ NATURE OF THINGS.

E’en these mistook the principles of things,

And greatly wander’d in attempt so great.

And, first, they deem'd that motion might exist

From vom exempt ε that things might still be rare,

Still soften, as earth, ether, fire, or fruits,

Or e'en the ranks of animated life,

Though von) commix'd not with their varying frames,

805

Then, too, they held no final term ordain’d

To comminuting atoms : which, through time,

Still crumbled on, and never could be least.

Though from such points as sense itself surveys,

Extreme and least, conjecture we may form

810

Of points extreme, impalpable to sight,

Least in themselves, that never can divide.

With them, moreo’er, the seeds of things were form’d

sofr, ancl unsolid: but whate’er is soft,

Whate’er unsolid, as at first they spring

elements of things for which Empedocles contended‚
are substances, in their very nature, hostile and op-
posite to each other3 and of course, whenever they
meet, must reciproeally annihilate each other, or
else be irregularly scattered abroad by a mutual
repulsive force. If, however, things could be cre-
ated from the junction of such jari-Ing and discor-
dant elements, why should fire, water, earth, and
air, be termed principles of other substanees, rather
than other substances principles of these? Every
thing is constantly changing into every thing, and
arising from every thing : and there is no more pro·
priety in denominating one thing an element than

815

another. But if the elemental atonis of Nature
could be separated and combined asresh3 if their
solidity could be once destroyed, from the change
in the motion or arrangement of which, every sub-
stance takes its different form and appearance: if
these could bc to-day pure elemental fire, to-mor-
row water equally unmixed and simple, then must
they long since have completely perished, and dis-
appeared : for every substance must inevitably waste,
and eventually perish, that is liable to change.
And it is to the solidity of primal seeds, or atoms
alone, that Nature is indebted for the unvaricd
regularity of her powers and phaenomena.
