violence of her affliction induced her to swallow some
portion of the ashes every day with hei· common beve-
rage, till she had consumed the whole, and had thus
constituted, of her own person, the tomb of her be-
loved husband. Fora further account of the ceremony

and requires uo critical finger to point out, either the
‹l-slicncy of its pathos, or the strength of its
argumeit. It is a perfect copy of the Athenian

to have had a xeference to that part of Plato's

transcription: the learned reader may consult it at
his leisure.
The Athenians were peculiarly celebrated for their
dix-ges, or funeral oration53 and Nardius, in an elabo-

rate dissertation on this subject, has judiciously in-

stanced the present address, as a proof of the ele-
gance and feeling which they introduced into com-
positions of this sort. Nor naaion, indeed, how-
ever barbarous and uncultivated, is without a dirge,
or lamentation of some sort, in which the virtues of
the deceased, and the irreparable loss sustaiued by
his friends, are rudely and clamorously, but at the
same time feelingly and forciffly, insisted upon. As
mankind acquire a greater degree of taste and polish,
this inharmonious howl is exchanged for the graces
of pathetic poetry‚ and the metrica] dirge and elegy
are sure to succeed. Among the Greeks, however,
the dirge acquired an excellence, and was rewarded
The
verses of which it consisted were uniformly adapted
to music, and repeated, not only over the grave, or
funeral pyre, according to the mode in which the re-
mains of the deceased were disposed of, but were af-
terwards remed, in a full band, during the exhibition
of funeral gamos and exercises„ performed shortly af—
terwcads at the place of sepulture.

with a liberality unknown to modern nationS.

This extrava-
gant pageantry, which was bestowed on all whose
pecuniary circumstances were equal to it, was, never—
theless, quadrupled upon the· death of a favourite pa-
triot or warrior: on which occasions, the expence
incurred was enormouS, and always discharged out of
the public pursc. The death of Evagoras affords us
an instance of this extreme prodigality 3 for his fune-
ral was celebrated with games ofalmost every descrip-
tion ; with poetry, music, gymnastic exercises, horse-
races, galley-prizes, and public feasting without li-
mits. In like manner, on the arrival, in the hai-bour
at Corinth, of the ashes of Demetrius, which were
conveyed in a golden urn, covered with a magnificent
canopy, and sui-mounted with a regal crown, a troop
of young noblemen were deputed to receive the
splendid present on its landing3 and Xenophantus,
the most celebrated musician of his age, was com-
mandcd to exert himself to the utmost in rehem-sing
