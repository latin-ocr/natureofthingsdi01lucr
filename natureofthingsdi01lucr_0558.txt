DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. ΙΙΙ.

Aut aliquo quom jam sucus de corpore cessit:

Nihil oculis tamen esse minor res ipsa videtur

Propterea, neque detractum de pondere quidquam.

Nimirum, quia multa minutaque semina sucos

Ecficiunt‚ et odorem, in toto corpore rerum.

Qua} re etiam atque etiam mentis naturam, animaeque,

Scire licet perquam pauxillis esse creatam

Seminibus3 quoniam fugiens nihil ponderis aufert.

Nec tamen haec simplex nobis natura putanda est:

Tenuis enim quaedam moribundos (leserit aura,

Mixta vapore3 vapos porro trahit a'e'ra secum:

Nec calor est quisquam, quoi non sit mixtus et a‘er.

rarity and its beauty. The stone is an amethyst‚ the
purple colour of which is admirably characteristic of
the subject engraven. Under this type, the jolly
god is commonly denominated Acamus, from the
name of a favour-ite and attendant genius upon him.
The gem Ι have now referred to, is thus vivaciously
described in alate publication : “ Acratus is crowned
with myrtle‚ ivy, and rose-budS, with wings on his
shoulders, and his right arm wrapped in his dress.
Pausanias, deser-ibing the representations of the gods
which decorated the mansion of Polybiou, dedicated
in his time to Bacchus, mentions Aci-atus an attend-
ant genius on the god of wine, and describes his
conntenance projecting from the wall. He informs
us, that the Amiclei adored Bacchus under the name
of PsitA, which in the Doric signified wmo. Wne,
be adds, lightens and exalts the soul, as wings, birds.”

Chcmistry is daily becoming so popular a pursuit, ax
well for entertainment as profit, in almost every art
and science, and its own technical dialect is hence so
perpetually and imperceptibly blending with collo-
quial language, that it is perhaps unnecessary to
offer any apolog-y for the introduction οἱ the term
gass, since every one is acquainted with its meaning,
and there is no other term in modern speech that will
so forcibly express the import of the Latin phrase
here adopted by our poet—tenuis aura. We come
now to the analysis of the Epicurean sou13 in ex-
plaining which, if the student of Lavoisier should in
some instances trace an erroneous chemistry‚ he will,
nevertheless‚ be astonished at the general resemblance
which it bears to this boasted theory of the present'
day; and will be truly surprized to find himself so
much at home whilst in company with a poet and a
philosopher who flourished nearly two thousand years
ago.

The sentient principle then, upon the Epicurean
hypothesis, is a system or combination of gasses
