‚, occasions than one, indebtcd to Cicero, Cicero to Atticus, Brutus to

Cassius, and Cassius to Velleius.

Into these perversities of political life, however, Lucretius never
entered. The high road to tho first dignities of tho state was open to
himself, as well as to his l'riends; and from tho illustrioris antiquity os
his family, his own mental endowmentS, and lhe support of his 11111011·-
stuclents‚ had ambition been his ruling passion, he could hare gm-
tified it to saticty. In this ease, freni the glowing patriotism, and
inextinguishablc love of liberty, which are so conspicuous in his poem,
and which it was not in the power of the deepest retirement to eradi-
cate, there can bc no doubt, that he would have united with Brutus
in the conspiracy against Cacsar: and it would have been highly gra-
tifying to the virtuous heart, to have beheld, at a distance of more
than four hundred years, the immediate descendants of the two fami-
lies, who had stimulated the people to throw off the tyranny of the
Tarquins, once more at the head of a plot concerted to rescue their
country from the chains of a tyrant possessed of infinitely more ar-
tifice and address. But the life of Lucretius did not extend to this
period, nor did his bosom pant for the possession of public honours
and renown. He saw, in the history of his own family, abundant
instanees ofthe instability of that happiness which depends upon the ca-
price of the multitude ; and how fatal to the preservation of virtue and
serenity ofmind, are those temptations, to which the candidate for poli-
tical fame is perpetually exposed. These are evils which he not only saw
but felt, for he repeatedly adverts to them, and dwells in the most
impressive manner, upon their magnitude and fatality. T emperance
and tranquillity, he had been taught in every lecture at Athens, were
the only foundations of au unshaken felicity—and Epicurus had more
attractions in his eye than the forum or the senate.
