DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. ΙΙ.

Per quarn progredimur, quo ducit quemque voluptas3

Declinamus item motus, nec tempore certo,

Nec regione loci certa, sed uti ipsa tulit mens ,Ρ

260

Nam, dubio procul, hiis rebus sua quoique voluntas

Principium dat3 et hinc motus per membra rigantur.

Nonne Vides etiam, patefactis ternpore puncto

Carceribus, non posse tamen prorumpere equorum

Vim cupidam tam de subito, quam mens avet ipsa?

265

Omnis enim totum per corpus materiai

Copia conquiri debet, concita per artus

Omneis‚ ut studium mentis connexa sequatur:

Ut videas initum motus a corde creari,

Ex animique voluntate id procedere primum;

270

Inde dari porro per toturn corpuS, et artus.

diametrically opposite, are at variance in their direc-
tion, and cannot both be complied with at the same
time, that a line altogether different, and immedi-
ately between the two, would be the necessary result ;
and that a man who had an equal inclination to walk
from Lincoln's-inn to Highgate, and to Mile-end,
should be compelled, if he moved at all, to proceed
to Hackney as a point nearly between the two.

These are situations, as Montagne has justly re-
marked‚ that never can occur with respect to the
mind: but they are facts which are daily occurring
with respect to the exterior world, and which, in
consequence, clearly elucidate, that a difference ex-
ists between them; a diffuence, as Lucretius ob-
serves, betwccn mental motives‚ and material causa-
nom—between moral and physical necessity.

 

Ver. 270. Dost thou not see, as down the bart-ier drops
Tha! reins the racer, &c. ] This beautiful
picture of the unquenchable ardour of the racc-horse,
admirably heightened by the abruptness of the ques-
tion which presents him immediately before uS, is

 

copied from our poet by Virgil in a variety of instan-
ces, and is also imitated by Statius.

Thus Georg. i. 5¹²· but more particularly

Nonne vides, quum praecipiti certamine cam-
pum

Conripuere‚ ruuntque, effusi carcere currus Ξ

 

GEORG. iii. 103.

Dost thou not see, as down the barrier drops,
How, in rash strife, the rival cars contend
Swift bursting o’er the plains ?
