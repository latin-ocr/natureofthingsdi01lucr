THE NATURE OF THINGS.

63

Still atoms dwell, tho’ viewless still to sense.

And, first, th' excited wind torments the deep3

WVrecks the tough bark, and tears the shivering clouds:

Now, with wide whirlwind, prostrating alike

O'er the waste champian, trees, and bending blade;

315

And now, perchance, with forest-sending force,

Rocking the mighty mountains on their base.

So vast its fury I-——But that fury Hows

Alone from viewless atoms, that, combin’d, v

Thus form the fierce tornado, raging wild

320

O’er heav’n‚ and earth, and ocean's dread domain.

 

the waters swelled with heavy raim,

And melted snows, had deluged all the plains;
And, loudly foaming, with resistless force,

Had borne the bridge before them in their course.

Thomson‚ in his description of an autumnal flood,
has forgotten to introduce th=s piene of imageqr, but
in other respects he is minutcly picturesque, and pos·
sest of considerable merit.

Red from the hills innumerable streame

Tumultuous roar3 and high above its banks

The river lift: before whose rushing tide

Herds, flocks, and harvests, cottages and swains,

Roll mingled down—all that the winds had spar'd

[n one wild moment ruin'd.

Aurum«, l. 337.

But the bold and energetic muse of the Spanish
poet Ercilla, has far surpassed both the Italian and
the English. To this admirable hard, as well as
gallant soldier, 1 have already adverted, and shall
have frequent occasion to refer. A variety of his
delineations prove him to have been well acquainted
with Lucretius, and well worthy of imitating him.

The passage Ι now allude to occurs in the ninth

canto of his Araucana near the commencement, and
comprises the opening of the tempest that announced

the visible appproach of the Indian daemon Epona-
mon:

Subito comenco el ayre ὲι turbarse‚

Y de prodigies tristes se espessava:
Nuves con nuves vienen ‘a ceri-arse,
Turbulento rumor se levzmtava,

Qe con ayrados impitus violentos
Monstravan su furor los quatro vientos‚
Agua rezia, gramm, piedra espessa
Las intrica das nuves despendian
Rayos‚ huenos, relampagos, apriessa
Rompen los cielos y la tierra abrian.

The air grew troubl'd with portentous sound,
And mournful omens multiplied around:
With furious shock the elements engage,

And all the wInds contcnd in all their rage-
From clashing clouds their mingled torrenta· gush,
And ναὶη, and hail, with rival sury rush .·

Bolts of loud thunder, floods of lightning rend
The opening skies, and into earth descend.
