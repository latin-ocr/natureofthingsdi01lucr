THE NATURE OF THINGS.

87

Tho’ deem’d existenceS, yet of themselves

Existed never: on material things,

On place and persons acting,

Alone dependent.

or coerc'd, 5 2 0

These revolving years

Have long th' irrevocable doom assign’d:

And rape and conquest, as EVENTS that claim’d

From these existence, now exist no more.—

Had ne'er been form’d the matter, or the space,

VVhose pow’r conjunctive gave those scenes to be;

No fite had e'er, from lovely HELEN'S eyeS,

Glanc’d thro’ the bosom of the TROJAAN youth,

nion different from that of the world at large, it is
curious to observe with what facility he can muster up
the whole phalanx of his learning in demonstration of
the fancy for which he means to eontend. And
hence, Mr. Bryant, it must be confessed, has written
with much plausibility upon this well controverted
though heterodox subject. But he has been opposed
several antagonists‚ who have all proved themselves
worthy of the cause they have undertaken to defend.
Mr. Wakefield has replied to him with an equal de-
gree of classical eruditiori : and with the potent
shield of a Hector, has maintained the classic towers
of Troy against the intended overthrow of this lite-
rary AjaX. Mr. Dallaway has also, in his “ Excur-
sions to the Troad,'' ἃς. followed the footsteps of
Mr. Wakefield, and exerted his abilities on the same
subject with much critical learning, local accuracy,
and desirable success. But Mr. Bryant appears to
have met with a still sturdier champion in M. Cheva-
lier, whose “ Tableau dela Plaine de Troye” is a pub-
lication deserving of all praise ; and replete with ar-
guments so subversive of the observations of both
Le Bossu and Mr. Bryant, that the latter gentleman
could not refrain from a reply to this truly ingenious
pamphlet: in which, however, he does not appear

to me to have been more successful than in his first
attempt. A concise account of this elaborate Ta-
bleau of M. Chevalier‚ is given in vol. iv. of the
Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, by
Professor Dalzel 3 who, in corroboration of the truth
of its statementS, has also added many ingenious pas·
sages and illustrations from historians and subsequent
travellers. To complete the triumph of Homer, Dr.
Chandler and Mr. Gell have since satisfactorily, and
from ocular observation, pointed out the very spot on
which the city was built, and identified the site ofits
gates, its groves, and itu rivers.

Ver. 527. Nofire hade'emfrom lovely HELI-:rsts eyes,

The effect of love is variously described, as well
as accounted for, by the poets. Generally, however,
the instrument supposed to be employed, is either
a dart from the eye, producing a wound, as in v, 36,
of the present book ; or else a species of subtle and
irresistible flame, eroding and consuming the bosom,
as in the present passage. In the opening of book iv,
of the AEneid,Virgil introduces both these metaphors,

Vulnus alit venis, et caeco carpitur igni.
She feeds her wound‚ and pines with secret fire.
