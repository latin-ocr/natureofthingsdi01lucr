DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. III.

Heic exsultat enim pavor, ac metus3 haec loca circum,

Laetitiae mulcent: heic ergo mens, animusque, est,

Caetera pars animae, per totum dissita corpus,

Paret3 et ad numen mentis, momenque, movetur:

145

quue sibi solum per se sapit, et sibi gaudet,

Quom neque res animam, neque corfmS, conmovet unfit,

Et, quasi quoni caput, aut oculus, tentante dolore,

Laeditur in nobis, non omni concruciamur

Corpore3 sic animus non numquam laeditur ipse,

150

Laetitistque viget, quom caetera pars anima's

Per membra atque artus null& novitate cietur.

Verum, ubi vehementi magis est conmota metu mem,

Consentire animam totam per membra videmus:

Sudoresque ita, palloremque, exsistere toto

other philosophers of the same country contended,
that its residence was divided,—that the irascible
part of the mind alone occupied the beart, but that its
rational portion resided in the brain. Of this latter
sentiment were Aristode, Plato, Pythagoras, and
Hippocrates. The doctrine here delivered by Lu-
cretius is only a dilatation of the very words of Epi·
curus. Diogenes Laertius has thus preserved them z

The terms mind, seul, and spirit, as I have already

observat, are generally used synonimously in the

 

Epicurean philosophy: but when in conformity
with popular language, it makes adifference ς it then
applies the term, mind or spirit, to that more con-
centrated part os this etherial substance which it
imagined to reside in the heart and praecordia ; and
the term soul, to its more dilute and distant radia-
tions‚ that give life and energy to the other organs,
and especially the limbs and extremities. The com-
mentator on Creeeh’s translation appears to have
been totally unacquainted with the physiology os the
Epicurean sou13 and is hence continually pointing
out errors and contradictions‚ which only existed in
his own misconception of the poem.
