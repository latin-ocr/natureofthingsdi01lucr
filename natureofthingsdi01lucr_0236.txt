DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. 1.

Clara adcendisset- saevi certamina belli ;

Nec clam durateus Troianis Pergama partu

Inflammasset equus nocturno Graiugenarum:

Pei-spicere ut possis, res gestas funditus omneis

Non ita, utei corpus, per se constare, neque esse τ

480

Nec ratione cluere eadem, qua constat inane ε

Sed magis ut merito possis eventa vocare

Corporis, atque loci, res in quo quaeque gerantur.

Corpora sunt porro partim primordia rerum,

Partim concilio quae constant principiorum.

Petrarc follows our poet’s latter image alone in the
ensuing description ε

Ι che l’esca amorosa al petto avea

Qal maraviglia se di subito arsi ?

What wonder, that I burn and smart,
Since love’s keen torch inflames my heart.
Solonion has beautifully and boldly introduced an-
other system οἱ imagery‚ the elegance, and indeed the
meaning of which has seldom been sufficiently ex-
plained. Under his creative powers, the fascinating
fair becomes the surrounding wall of a fortified city ς
which was often erected with consummate sscill, beau-
tified with all the ornaments of architectpre, and over
different parts of which were projected towers or tur-
rets for the purpose of repelling the assailing foe ; in

whose construction and finish the taste of the artist
was principally exerted, and which were hence fre-
quently denominatcd towers qfivory or ossilver. The
triumphant fair being thus generally resembled to the
beautiful and ornamental wall of a defensive city-
her white aud swelling bosom is next compared to the
white and swelling turrets projected from its surface,
-to those elegant, but dangerous prominences, which
were equally formed for the purpose of attack or re-
pulsion‚ aud which uo man, in either case, can

approach without extreme peril. With this intro-
ductory explanation the passage I refer to is equally
exquisite and obvious.

Call her a wall—‘ and’ two towers of silver

Will we build upon her.—

I myself am a wall,

And my bosom resembles two towers.

Chap. viii. 9. 10.

For a still farther illustr-atlon, the reader may con-
sult my version and notes upon this elegant simile,

Ver. 531. Pour’djbrth at nfight,—] Hence Vir-
gil,

Invadunt urbem somno vinoque sepultam ε

Caeduntur vigiles ε portisque patentibus omnes

Accipiunt socios, atque agmina conseiajungunt.

ΖΕΝ. ii. 265.

A nameless crowd succeed ; their forces join

T’ invade the town, oppress'd wilh slecp and wine.

Those few they find awake, first meet their fate,

Then to their fellows they unbar the gate.
