>THE NATURE OF THINGS.

„39

And all his soul hangs quiv'ring from thy lips„

O! while thine arms in fond embraces clasp

40

His panting members, sov'reign of the heart!

Ope thy bland voice, and intercede for ROME.

For, while th' unsheathed sword is brandish'd‚ vain

And all unequal is the poet’s song3

And vain th’ attempt to claim his patron⁷s ear.

45

Son of the ΜΕΜΜΙΙ l thou, benignam, too,

Freed from all cares, with vacant ear attend ;

Nor turn, contemptuous, ere the truths I sing,

For thee first harmoniz'd‚ are full perceiv'd.

Lo 1 to thy view I ,spread the rise of things ;

with such frequent parallelisms of expression, of fi-
gure and phraseology, in Lueretius, with what oc-
cur in the Hebrew Scriptures, of which the reader
will find many pointed out to him as he proceeds,
that 1 am myself half-tempted to believe the Roman
poet was no sti-anger, either to their existence, or
their bold poetic beauties: yet Ι can trace no suffi-
cient similarity between the passages in question, to
render it, in my own opinion, probable that the one is
a copy of the other. Let the reader, however, consult
sor himself. lf Lucretius were in· reality acquainted
with the sacred books of the Jews, it was perhaps
by means of some persons 'of this nation, who were

· resident at Rome, through which city great numbers

of Jews were at this period scattered, as there were
also throughout all Greece, and almost every part of
the Roman dependencies. It was probably from the
same source that Virgil, not. long afterwards, de-
rived his knowledge of the prophecies of Isaiah ; and
Longinus, still later, his acquaintance with the cos-
mogony of Moses. It should be renieinbered also,
that the Hebrew Scriptures had been long translated
into Greek, by the seventyinterpreters‚ who flourished

50

in the reign of Ptolemy, and executed their version
at his express desire. In consequence of which Dr-
Warton openly asserts, that Theocritus was well ac-
quainted with this version, and copied largely from the
Song of Songs into his own Idylls. Dr. Hodgson‚ in-
deed, maintains the same with respect to Anacreon ε
but it is often difficult to distinguish between original
parallelisms and imitatious3 and hence the following,
from Thomson, may or may not be a copy:

who can speak

The mingl'd passions that surpris’d his beart,

And through his net-ves ἱη shiv'ring transport mn ἓ

Ver. 43. For, while th’ unshcathed swerd is bran—
dish'd‚—] For an account of the probable

period of time when Lucretius began his poem on thc
Nature of Things, see note on ver. 1. of this book.
His address to Venus, for the restoration of permanent
peace, was not, however, attended with much suc-
cess; since for more than half a century after the
termination of the Jugurthinc war, the republic was
still violently and perpetually agitated by the ambi.
