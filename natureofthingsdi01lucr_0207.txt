THE NATURE OF THINGS.

59

When, on the bosom of maternal EARTH,

His showers redundant genial ETHER pours,

The dulcet drops seem lost: but harvests 1156,

Jocund and lovely3 and, with foliage fresh,

Smiles every tree, and bends beneath its fruit.

Hence 111311 and beast are nourish'd ε hence o’erflow

Our joyous streets with crowds of frolic youth 3

And with fresh songs th’ umbrageous groves resound.

Hence the herds 1311611, and repose at ease,

295

O'er the gay meadows, their unwieldy forms ;
While from each full-distended udder drops

The candid milk spontaneous ς’ and hence, too,

With tottering footsteps‚ o'er the 16111161 grass,

La pioggia 111 56 raccoglie, e si rintegra,

E la compar-te alle piu interne vene ε

Ε largamente i nutritivi umori

Alle piante ministra, all’ erbe, ai fiori, &c-
CAN-r. xiii.

 

Earth that late her gaping rifts disclos’d,
And fainting lay to parching beat expos’d,
Receives and ministers the vital show⁷rs
To fading hex-bs, to plants, 1ο trees, and flow'rs :
Her fever thus allay'd, new health returns,

No more the flame within her bosom burns ;
Again new beauties grace her gladden'd soil,
Again renew’d, her hills and valleys smile.
Ηοοιε.
Long 35 11115 note is, and numerous as are its re-

ferenees, I cannot conclude it without instancing a

parallel passage of Hebrew poetry‚ which, in point

of sublimity and elegance, surpasses even Lucretius

himself. The reader will find it in Psalm 11111. 9. 13.

Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it ;
Thou abundantly enriehest it

With the ‘ dewy’ stream of God‚ replete with
water.

Thou preparest‚ and fittest it for corn ε

Τ11011 drenchest its furrows ; its· clods thou dis-
solvest ;

Τ11011 mellowest it with showers; thou blessest its
increase 3

And with thy bounty thou crownest the year.

Thy footsteps drop fatness ; they drop on the pas-
tures of the desert,

And the hillocks are begirt with exultation.

The pastures are clothed with flocks, the vales are
covered with corn ;

They all shout and sing aloud for joy.

Ver. 299. With totteringfhotsteps‚-] The descrip-
tion here given us of the lamb just dropped into the
world is not more beautiful than accurate. Dyer
who, to the advantage of much original geuiuS, added
a strict attention to the various phaenomena of nature,
has a picture of the same subject in his FLEEcn.
