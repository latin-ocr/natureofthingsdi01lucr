THE NATURE OF THINGS.

Combin’d, and fitted to each rising want.

Nor small of import are the modes diverse

In which theme seeds approach, recede, or blend:

Since heaven, and earth, and sunS, and scas immense,

Herbs, instinct, reason, all are hence deriv'd:

The mode‘ but chang'd, the matter still the same.

Thus, though the lines, these doctrines that recite,

Flow from the same fixt elemental types,

Yet line from line, in sense, in sound compar'd,

Egregious differs.

Re—arranged alone,

by parts, or in different place or order. When two
fflanglcs, being put together, make a square, that
square is still nothing but two triangles ε or when a
square cut in half makes two triangles, those two
triangles are still only the two halves of a square3 or
when a mixture of blue and yellow powder makes a
green, that green is still nothing but blue and yel-
low intermhced, as is plainly visible by the help of
microscopes.” Demonstration of the Being, &c. of

Nothing can afford a stronger proof of the very ex-
traordinary manner in which the same substance, un-
der one arrangement or modification of its primary
particles, may differ from the same substance when
under another, than some late experiments of Mr.
Chevenix, upon a supposed new metal, entitled Pal-
ladium3 in the course of which he discovered that
platina, whose specific gravity is more than 22, com-
bined with mercury, whose specific gravity is nearly
14, produced a mass whose gravity was not more
than about 11. These experiments are stated in a
paper inserted in the Philosophical Trans-actions for
1803 ; and they lead to an additional remark, which
is too much in point to be omitted ι “ Α no less ex-
traordinary degree of irregular density is daily before

our eyes ; yet it has not so much as attracted our at-
tention. It is true that it is taken from among the
gases. But, if we suppose that we have attained ac-
curacy in experiments upon these subjects, Ι see no
reason to refuse their evidence in this instance. The
density of oxygen gas to that ofwater is as 1 to 740;
and the density of hydrogen gas, as 1 to 9792. The
mean density of that proportion of oxygen and hy-
drogen gases which constitutes water, is to that of
water as 1 to 2098; or, in other words, water 'is
2098 times heavier than the mean density of its ele-
ments in the gaseous state. But water is only 1200
times beavier than steam, or water in the state of va-
pour. Therefore there is a variation in -Ι-, of 898,
or nearly half, between the density of water and its
elements, when both are in the aeriform state. This
fact, however, regards bodies only as they remain in

.the same state, whether of solidsty, liquidity‚ or flui-

dity. The anomaly is much greater, if we„ contem-
plate them as they pass 'from one of these states to
the other. Yet we must not omit the consideration
of such a change, in the instance of mercury alloyed
with platina; for the former metal, before liquid,
becomes solid as it enters into the new combina-
tion-’³
