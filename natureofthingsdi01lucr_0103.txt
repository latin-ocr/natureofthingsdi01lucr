minutely into this subject would occupy far too much space, and Ι
refer the reader, therefore, to the following poem, Book HI. v. loo—265.
and the explanatory notes which will be found appended. Let it at
present suffice to obscrve, that the mind was supposed to be tho rc-
sult ofa combination of the most volatile and etherial auras-or gasscs,
diffused over the whole body, though traced inaniore concentratc
form in some organs than in others. Nor could any conception be
more correct or happy: it is the very philosophy of the vpresent day,
boldly predicted and accurately ascertained. Such, from the clearest and
most convincing expe1·imentS‚ are the sources ofall nervous communica-
tion; and why may not a certain modification ofsnch gasses constitute the
mind itself, and form the very texture of that separate state of existence
which the infallible page ofrevelation clearly indicates will be ours? Ana-
logy, I admit, points out to uS, as it did to Epicurus and his disciples,
that such a texture can be no more incorruptible, than the less subtilized
body itself, which is avowedly doomed to the grave3 and it may more-
over be questioned, whether a fraino so attenuate be capable either
of organization⁹ or permanent endurance. As the suggestions osana-
logy, however, are erroneous with respect to the body, we can place
no dependence upon them with reg-ard to the mind, admitting it to be
material in its frame. Matter is not necessarily corruptible under any
form. The body, which is now mouldering in ils grave, will hereafter
experience a glorious resurrection; the corruptible will put on incor-
ruption3 the mortalsimmortality. As then the material body is pri-
vileged to enjoy incorruptibility in a future period, so may the ma-
terial mind be privileged to enjoy it from its birth. Why it should
be requisite for that which seems to constitute one harmonious whole
to separate, and for the mind to exist by itself in an intermediate state
of ⁴ being, is a mysteryrwhich equally attaches to the material and im-
material systems. But the power that is capable of giving personality
and consciousness to matter in its grosser and more palpable form,
