The creed or system of iord Bolingbroke seems to have been
‘an intermixture of that of Spinosa and Leibnitz ; or, to ascend higher,
of the Pythagoric or Platonic, and the Eleatic schools 3 and hence the
celebrated Essay on Man, which was certainly planned by himself,
and composed by Mr. Pope, without his having been aware of its
tendency, at the direct instigation of his noble patron, discloses, in
every page, the doctrines of sufficient reason and a viaterial deity.- on
which account, on its first appearance, the poeni was regarded, and

ss To justify such observation, it is only necessary to compare this couplet, and the entire passage which
belongs to it, with the following verses of Virgil, who has derived the idea he exemplifies from the very

same source as Spinosa ι
