THE LIFE OF LUCRETIUS. lxxxvii

atonis, can it alone deserve such an appellation, if it deserve it under
any circumstances. Admit the existence of two or more atonis, and
whatever be the distance at which they are placed from each other, they
will begin to act with reciprocity ; diminish the distance, and the ac·-
tion will be sensible; the power of gravitation will obviously exert it-
self3 they will approximate, they will unite. In its simplest form,
therefore, matter evinces the desire of reciprocal union, or, as it is
commonly called, the attraction of gravitation. Increase its mass,-
arrange it in other modifications, and it immediately evinces other
powers or attractions and these will be perpetually, and almost in·
finitely, varied, in proportion as we vary its combinations. If arranged,
therefore, in one mode, it discloses the power of magnetism; in ano-
ther, that of electricity, or galvanism ; in a third, that of chemical af-
finities3 in a fourth, that of mineral assimilations, of which the very
beautifulflos ferri affords us a striking example. Pursue its modifica-
tions into classes ofa more complex, or rather, perhaps, of a more
gaseous, or attenuate nature, and it will evince the power of vegetable,
or fibrous irritability; ascend through the classes of vegetables, and.
you will, at length, rcach the strong stimulative perfection, the pal-
pable vitality of the miniosa pudica, or the hedysarum gyranS, the
former of which shrinks from the touch with the most bashful coy-
ness, while the latter perpetually dances beneath the jocund rays of
the sun. And when we have thus attained the summit of vegetable
powers and vegetable life, it will require, I think, no great stretch of
the imagination to conceive, that the fibrons irritability of animals, as*
well as vegetables, is the mere result of a peculial· arrangement ossius»

ple and unirritable material atonis.

 

But let us not trust to conjecture ; let us mark the progress of na-
ture through the animal kingdom, as 'well as through the vegeta=ble,.and2
