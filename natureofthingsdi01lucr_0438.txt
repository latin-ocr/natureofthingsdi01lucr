DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. ΙΙ,

Principiis esse, ante oculos quae candida cernis 3

Aut ea, quae nigrant, nigro de semine nata :

Neve alium quem vis quae sunt inbuta colorem,

Propterea gerere hunc credas, quod materiai·

Corpora consimili sint ejus tincta colore.

735

Nullus enim color est omnino materiai·

Corporibus, neque par rebus, neque denique dispar :

In quae corpora si nullus tibi forte videtur

Posse animi injectus fieri, procul avius erras.

Nam, quom caecigenei, solis quei numina numquam

ΒΕΞΡὲΧΕὙΘ, {alnes} cognoscant COI‘POI‘a tssCtU‚

Ex ineunte aevo nullo conjuncta colore3

Scire licet, nostrae quoque menti corpora posse

Vorti in notitiam, nullo circumlita fuco.

 

M. Ameilhon had studied the system of Epicurus,
he would have known, that much of this great se-
cret ofnature on the composition of light, and the
mechanism of colom-5, had been elucidated‚ and pub-
licly taught by this accurate philosopher, although
it does not appear that he had ever made use of a
pri-sm for the analysis of coloured light: an inven-
tion and application which exclusively appertain to
Sir Isaac. In the modern doctrine, however, there
tire many doubtful points, and the late experiments
of Dr. Herschell, upon radiant light and heat, will,
perhaps, establish a new era in this elegant study.

In advancing in his own day, what is now the
generally accredited liypothesiS, Lucretius was op-
posed hy the philosophers of every school but his
mvn, for they all contended, that colours were es-

sentia] ingrediente. of the coloured body; although

they differed, in some degree, from each other in
their modes of accounting for the productioris of co-
lour. The Stoics conceived that it was a pro·-
pcrty inherent in the elementary particles of matter ς
the Pythagoream, that it formed an essenti-'³1 part
of the surfaces of those particles when combined;
and the Peripatetics, that it resulted from different
intermixtnrcs of their four elementary qualities, beat,
cold, moisture, and dryness; while the Platonists
maintained, that colours were nothing more than
different combinations of light and darkness. Against
all these Lucretius mansully enters his protest; and
in a chain of rationatiom which does honour to the
human inrellect, proves that colour is a real qua-
lity, and not a substance ; an accident or event, as he
has ter-med it in ver. 509, Book L, and not a con·
junction: that its actual existence is in the light
