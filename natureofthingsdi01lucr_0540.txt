prepared for it, being totally incapable of existing
by itself‚ or in a state of total separation from
matter.

In effect, each of these philosophers equally be-
lieved in the existence of a soul, or intelligible prin-
ciple in the material world, independently of any
communication from the supreme, or immaterial divi-
nity ; and, thus believing, they indirectly maintained,
that matter of itself‚ under some modification or
other, was capable of sensation and thought. But
if pure, unmingled matter, be capable of such re-
sults, why have recourse to a second substance for
that which matter alone is competent to exhibit?
Why complicate causes, and multiply the machinery
beyond the necessity of the case? Such appear to
have been the vicws of Epicurus, and consequently
of our own poet, upon this abstruse subject3 and
hence they discarded from the soul, or principle
of thought and intelhgence, every thing but sim-
ple, unalloyed matter. ln the gradual operations
of nature, they traced from matter alone, the ori-
gin of general gravitation, magnetism, irritabi-
lity, and sensation: and, they hence saw no occa—
sion for the introduction of a foreign substance, in
the formation of thought, the mere result of this
last quality, when sufficiently accumulated, or con—
centrated.

On these accountS, therefore, the system of Epi-
curus had to oppose, both the belief of the people,
and the dogmas of other philosophers, who, as
appears above, united in the conception, that an irn-
material, as well as a material principle, was con-
cerned in the creation of the human soul. But there
were certain classes of materialists, as well as immate-
rialists, whom the present system had equally to coun-
ter-act: and especially those who, like Aristoxenus,
maintained the soul, or sentient principle, to result
from the harmonicus adaptation of organ to organ,
and limb to limb, as a whole, and those who, fol-
lowing the tenets of Democritus, conceived that
it consisted alone of a certain number of per-
cipient primordial atoinS, inter-§persed throughout

the body in the midst of a much larger mass of im-
percipient.

In opposition to these two last opinions more es-
pecially, Lucretius attempts to prove, in the first
place, that the sentient principle consists alone ofa
combination of certain etherial gasses, or auras, im-
bibed with the breath from the atmosphere, secerned
in due proportions by the bronchial vessels and
lungs, and hence conveyed to the heart; and, se-
condly, that in consequence of such mechanism, the
heart and praecordia are the chief seat of the seul, or
intelligent spirit ς hence radiating, as from a centre,
towards every orgari and extremity of the entire sys-
tem. Modern chemistry‚ applied to modern ana-
tomy, has, in many instances, as the reader will per-
ceive in the prosecution of the present work, made a
very considerable approach towards the former of
these dogmas; it has proved, that the blood, as well
as various other fluids, after their union with these
secerned gasses, is possessed, in the language of Μ.
Blumenbach, of a kind of perpetual bildungstrieb, or
formative nidus, while through the whole course of
the nerves it has enabled us to trace a secretiori and
incessant efflux ofwhat is‚in our own day, denominated
pure galvanic aura: a fluid which is probably sepa-
rated by the vast gland of the brain, and which we
now know, to a certainty, constitutes the living
principle, or spirit of animation.

From the immense importance of the heart and
brain to the preservation of life and health, it has,
under almost every theory, been conceived, that the
mind or soul, whether material or immaterial, re·-
sides more immediately in the one or the other of
these organs, than in any different part of the human
