DE RERUM NATURA.

It is surprising to perceive how excessively mistaken
all the cn'tics and commentators upon this passage
have hitherto been, while nothing, if they had really
understood our poet, can be more obvious. All the
Grecian schools of philosophy alike maintained the
eternity of matter: but they differ-ed as to the mode
inwhich motion, and the present appearances of things
first began. Anaximander maintained, that the in-
finite and primary matter, whence even the gods
themselves were formed, was the first intelligent
source of all things.
more philosophie, represented the world as in itaerfa
rational being ; and pretended that by the operation
of an interior soul or spirit, it had produced and con-
tinued to sustain the beauty and order universally
exhibited. Such also, with little variation, was the
opinion of Pythagoras, Socrates, Plato, and Trisme-
gistus: and Virgil has given us their creed, as the
quintessence ofwisdom and truth. It is thus Anchi-
ses addi-esses his son :
Principio caelum, ac terras, camposque liquentes,
Lucentemque globum Lunae, Titaniaque astra
Spiritus intus alit, totamque infusa per attus
Mens agitat molem et magno se corpore miscet.

to avoid the absurdity which, in a large degree at-

the world was first put into motion: by conceiving
this extrinsic divinity to be both eternal and supreme,
and by asserting that the souls of all intelligent and
rational beings are created by him, from slips or
particles of the divinity of the world, and continue
scattered, like cuttings, or seeds of vegetables,
through the sun, moon, and planets, ready to unite
themselves with the young embryon ou its first
evincing a principle of vitality. Democritus, how-
ever, advanced farther than any of these sects: he
not only supposed the world, in its congregate state,
to be an animated being, but that many of the ele-
mentary atoms themselves were intelligent and per-
cipient in their own simple and uncompounded state ς
and that the sublime work of creation was produced
from the joint counsel and determination of this or-
der, when assembled in a kind of synod; a doctrine
which, in modern times, appears, in some measure,
to have been supported by Leibnitz and Hobbes,
with this simple difference, that whereas Democri-
tus divided his elemental atoms into a percipient and
an impercipient class, Hobbes maintained, that no
argument could disprove that all the atoms of mat-
ter were not only endowed with figure, and a ca-
pacity of motion, but also with an actual sense or
perception; and that they merely require the or-
gans and memory of animals to express their sen-
sations. Scio fuisse philosophos quosdam, eosdem-
que viros doctos, qui cor-pora omnia sensu praedita
esse sustinuerunt; nec video, si natura sensionis iu
reactione sola collocarentur, quomodo refutari possint,

Against an these absurd doctrines and hypotheseS,

our poet is here enter-ing his rational protest. He
teus us, that they are equally made up of incon-
gruities‚ if not of contradictions:
