Book- ΙΙΙ. THE NATURE OF TIIINGS.

Th’ enfuriate tide that ceaseless taves within.
For ampler vapour mark the timid deer:
Quick spreads its chilling dew through every limb
In many a tremour quivering3 while the ox
Proves, through his placid life, a temper form'd
From air supreme. Him ne'er the torch of ire
Maddens abrupt in clouds and smoke involv'd‚
Nor shudd'ring fear transfixes3 but, remote,
’Twixt both he stands, and lifts his honest front,
The trembling deer, the lion gaunt and grim.
Thus varies man: though education trim

⁴ Add its bland polish‚ frequent still we trace
The first deep print of nature on the soul,

Nor aught can all—erase it ε ever, whence,

This yields to sudden rage, to terror that,

While oft a third beyond all right betrays

A heart of mercy. Thus, in various modes,
The moral temper, and symphoneous life

Must differ3 thus from many· a cause occult

The sage can ne'er resolve, nor human speech

But education sires the mind, Thus, Akenside, and in nearly the same words :

Its native strength recalls, with wige intent
When Genius, loose, and unconfin’d, The hand of Nature
To Vice a captive falls.

 

Ver. 319. frequent still we truce
The-first deep print qs nature on the soah]

 

on peculiar minds
Imprints a different bias, and to each
Deci-ees its province in the common toil.
