Boos ΙΙ. ΤΗΕ NATURE OF THINGS. 259

‘'‘Yet could creation's utmost scope produce
A form unparallel'd by 311 that breathe5‚
Alone and individual,-were the base
Not infinite whence first the monster spmng,
How sprang he themar all ? nor birth were 1115, 5 50
Nor e'en‚ though born, the power to nurture life.
But grant the primal atoms whence alone
Such individual springs, were finite found,
How( when, and where, by what concerted plan,
What pow’r innare, could e'er those atoms meet, 5 5 5
Through ocean, scatter'd of ungenial seeds Ρ
These time could never join. As when the main,
Work'd into fury, many a mighty ship

Wrecks ruthless‚ and tow'rds every coast impels

There is a bold picture of the same phaenomenon in
Dyer's Fleece‚ which 1 will transcribe for a compari-
son. He is speaking of Lord Anson’s trending
round the coasts of Patagonia :

Dyer, more especially the latter part of it, is drawn
from Voltaire‚ who thus expresses himself in his Hen-
riad :
L’astre brillant du jour Ξι l'instant s'obscurcit ;
L'air siffle, le ciel gronde, et l’onde au loiri mugit .·
Les vents sont dechaincsss sur les vagues emues ;
La foudre etincelante celate dans les nues ;

El leseu des eclam, et l’abyme desflots,

 

fast-garbering tempests rous’d

Huge Ocean, and involv’d him ε 311 around
Whirlwind‚ and snow and hail, and horror: now
Rapidly‚ with the world of waters, down
Descending to the channels of the deep, Mona-aient par-tout la mort aux pdles matelots.

He view'd th' uncover’d bottom of th' abyss, L· lv·
And now the star-s, upon the loftiest point
Toss’d of the sky-mixt surges. Oft the burst
Of loudest thunder‚ with the dash of seaS,

The reader may accept of the following version ι

At once dread darkness veils the briglrt day-
star;

 

Tore the wild-flying sails, and tumbling masts,

While flames, thick-flashing in the gloom‚ re-
veal'd

Ruins of decks and shrouds, and sights of death.
B. iv.

I much suspect, however, that this description of

Air sighs, heaven howls, and &cangi-oam- afin- .-
Loose fly the wild winds o’er the tortur'd waves,
Through the rent clouds thepealing thunder ravcs ς
Atrdfircs above, and bozmdless grtlphs below,

To the pale crew, new deaths, new darigcrs

σίναπυ.
