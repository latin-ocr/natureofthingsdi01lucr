THE NATURF, OF THINGS.

Drinks in new tinctures from the noon—tide blaze:

Now glows the ruby, and nOW, ting'd with blue,

Sports the green emerald o'er his glossy neck.

Falls the full beam, wears each prismatic dye.

Since, then, th’ impinging light each hue create5‚

So, without light, each, instant, must expire.

And as the stimulus the sight that strikes

are generally at a considerable distance from them·
Epicurus, therefore, conceived, that to produce in
‘the sight the sensation of colour, minute elementary,
particles, infinitesimal as the corpuscles of light, were
perpetually thrown off from the coloured substance,
which, impinging upon the retina, became a stimulus
to the sensation that immediately suceeeded, whether
it were a sensation of violet, green, or any other
colour. When Des Cartes established his system of
a plenum upon the ruins of that of Aristode, he ap-
proved, in some measure, of this Epicurean prin—
ciple of contact‚ but contended‚ as I have before
observed‚ and especially in the note on ver. 166 of
the present book, that there was no such thing as
a transmission of minute and viewless particles from
one body hereby operating upon another; maintain-
ing, instead of such a doctrine, that where two sub-
stances at a distance acted upon each other, it was
in consequence of a vibratory motion extended
through the elastic medium of the atmosphere‚ ex-
cited by the acting substance, and hereby affecting
the substance acted upon. This was his general
theory ; and hence he applied it to the subject now
under our consideration. Denying, as he did, the
transmission of extreme particles from a coloured
body to the retina of the eye, he maintained, that
the sensation and idea of colours arose from a pecu-
liar vibratory motion excited in the atmosphere by
⁷ bodies of peculiar colours‚ and communicated‚ in

consequence, to the retina. Newton, however, who
adopted the theory of Epicurus, respecting the
materiality of.light, and the perpetual emission of its
particles from the sun, emended, along with Epicu-
rus, this same theory to the solution of the sensation
of colours as well.

Mr. Locke is also full upon the same hypothesis,
to which he most cordially assented: and as it is
impossible to give a clearer explanation of the mean-
ing of Lucretius in the present instance, and more
especially as it will serve to elucidate many succeed-
ing phaenomena to which he adverts, Ι shall take the
liberty of transcribing from this most accurate phi-
losopher, the following passage. He has just been
speaking of the qualities of bodies, which, like Lu-
cretius, he denies to exist in the bodies themselves ε

“ The next thing to be considered is, how bo-
dies produce ideas in us: and that is mam-'festly by
impulse, the only way we can conceive bodies to ope-
rate in.

“ If then, external objects be not united to our
minds when they produce ideas in it, and yet we
pei-ceive these original qualities in such of them as
singly fall under our senses, it is evident, that some
motion must be thence continued by our nerves, or
animal spirits, by some parts of our bodies, to thc
brain, or the seat of sensation3 there to produce in
our minds the particular ideas we have of them.
And since the extension, figure, number, and mo-
