puet having established, as far as he was able, the
mortality of the human soul, proceeds, by a variety
of foreible and well-stlected arguments, to destroy
that unx-casonable dread uf death which, in his own
age inore especially, was perpetually liurrying man-
kind ints. a commission of the most flagrant crimes,
of which he has already enumerated many in the
opening of the present hook. The dread he‘here
refers to, still attaches to multitudes in our own age ;

and to mulffludes, moreover, wito, by the rectitude '

of their lix-es, and the superior knowledge imparted
to them by the glor-Eous dispensatiou of the gospel,
should bc releascd‘froni its influe-nce. Among Christ-
iaus of this character, tlic terror which so perpetu-
ally haunts them, proceeds, as it did amongst t'ne
greater ptirt of the philosophers of our poet's own
nera, from an ost-illatisn or (qual balance of hope and
fenr: not, indeed, with respect to th: existence of a
future state, but as to t'nsir own condition when
they hare entered upon it. Upon both thtse sub-

after all their researches, were they capable of obtain-
ing any satisfactory or certain information. They be-
lieved, and they disbelieved3 they hoped, and they
feared; and the arguments on each side appeared
equally indecisive. Grotius has a passage to the same
effect: Apud Graecos, observes he, ad quos eruditio us-
que a Chaldaeis et AEgyptiis perlata est, qui de vita
post hujus conspicuae vitae interitum spem habebant
aliquam, valde de ea re haesitanter loquebantur, &c-
“ The Greek philosophers, who derived their learn-
ing from the Chaldeans and EgyptianS, though they
had some idea ofa future life, spoke with extreme
hesitation concerning it; as is evident from the dia-
logues of Socrates, the writings of Cicero, Seneca,
and others : and though they searched diligently for
arguments in proof of what they desired, they could

It was on this account that Socrates, in his de—

this, as I have formerly noticed, was not all: for

nity iu a future state, if such were to be their por-
tion, and unacquainted with the precise means of ac-
quiring it, the trembling philosopher united in the
