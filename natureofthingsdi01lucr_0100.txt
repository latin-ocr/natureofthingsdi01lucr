lxxxvi THE LIFE OF LUCRETIUS.

tian scriptures‚ I admit, which have brought life, as well as immortalily,
to light, the present natm-e of man, as well as his future destiny‚ teach us,
in my apprehension, most clearly and unequivocally, not only that the
body will arise from the grave, but that the soul will exist antecedently
to such an eventin a state of separation. In this respect, therefore, the
Epicurean were more estranged from the truth than their opponents, or
rather the phaenomena of nature, in which they iinplicitly confided,
afforded them no direct evidence upon the subject, and tended to a
contrary conclusion: but so far as relates to the constitution of the
entire man, to the materiality of the soul itself, the indications of na-
ture, and their own deductions, appear to have been equally correct,
and by no means to be contradicted by revelation. To render the
soul immortal, why is it necessary that it should be immaterial ἓ Im-
matcrial is a term that does not occur in the scriptures: it has been
introduced in aid of reason alone; and it has, unquestionably‚ engen-

must hence be a thinking, and an immaterial p1inciple, and man
must still be a compound being.

Yet why thus degrade matter, the plastic and prolific creature of
the Deity, beyond what we are authorised to do? Why may it not
perceive, why not think, why not become conscious? What eternal
and necessary impediment prevents? or what sels-contradiction and
absurdity is hereby implied? Let us examine nature, as she presents
herself to us in her most simple and unorganized forms; let us trace
her through her gradual and ascending stages of power and perfectiori.

Matter is denominated inert and brutish: as an individual monad
or atom‚ however, and placed at an infinite distance from all other
