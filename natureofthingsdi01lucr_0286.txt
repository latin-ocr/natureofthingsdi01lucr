The atomic rudiments of Anaxagoras are, moreover,
too feeble and insignificant for his purpose. If large
masses of any substance, as of flesh, for example, be
from their nature subject to corruption and dissolu-
tion, the nature of the minute and original particles,
whence these are derived, being the same, such

particles must also be equally subject to dissolution,
and can never re-produce, by conjunctim, the same
masses again. Animals, again, who are a com·
position of antagonist qualities and powers, of bony
hardness, and adipose softness, of dry tendons,
and liquid blood, are often nourished by a single
species of food. But if the system of Anaxagoras
be true, every individual species capable of nourish-
ing an animal, must, in itself, be composed of ad-
verse, and opposite qualities; it must be, at the
same time, hard and sost, moist and dry. And to
prove the absurdity of such an opinion in a manner
still more obvious, he proceeds to observe, that as
smoke‚ flame, and ashes, are all and equally educible
from timber, each of these primary and opposite
substances must have existed in the timber at the
same time, prior to their separation ; and that each
of them, moreover, must have been perpetually im-
bibed from the earth, as the tree increased in its
dimensions.

This hypothesis of Anaxagoras has seldom been
embraced in its utmost latitude by modern philoso-
phers and physiologists, but there are many opi-
nions which evince a strong assimilation to it. Such
is the doctrine of convertible and sympathctic me-
dicines, which, less than a century ago, was uni-
versally assented to by the first physicians in every
country3 who, like Anaxagoras, appear to have
imagined, that every part of the human frame re-
ceived its nutriment, and recovered its health, from
a digestion of the same parts of other animals, or
from herbs of parallel or assimilating qualities. Thus
the testes of the wild boar, reduced to powder,
were esteenied an antidote in cases of barrenness;
the lungs ofa lamb, employed in the same manner,
in pulmonic diseases3 the medulla of all animals, in

disorders of the nerves3 and sperma ceti, or the fat
of the whale, an infallible remedy in cases of rna-
rasmus, or general loss of fat from any internal dis-
ease, a remedy which has not even yet lost its good
name with many practitioners, who still continue to
believe, that
——the sovereign’st thing on earth,
Is parmaceti for an inward bruise.

Thus, too, in the botanic productioris of the
earth, nothing, about a century ago, was esteemed
of such infallible utility for diseases for the eyes as
the herb in our own language denominated Eye—
bright ; for a pain in the side as Stich-wort ; for
ruptures as Solomon’s-seal; for lascivious ideas as
the Agnus Dei, or Chaste-tree ; for disorders of
the bladder as Kidney—beans; and even in the pre-
sent day, Scurvy-grass‚ among the vulgar, is held
of paramount advantage in scorbutic complaints.
Those who are acquainted with the writings of
Etmuller‚ and Cole, published towards the latter
end of the seventeenth century, will easily recall
to mind a thousand such instances of sympathy
and conversion, which uniformly seem to im-
ply a general belief in some such doctrine as the
homoeomeria of Anaxagoras. M. Bonhornme's the·
ory of the operation of calcareous phosphat‚ and 'its
great advantage in the‘ disease of the rickets, though
far better founded, and of the date of the present
day, is not very dissimilar in its origin.

But thereare othersystemswhichbear a still stronger
resemblance to this doctrine. A few years ago, the
female ovarium was supposed to be filled with cysts,
and every cyst was conceived to be a perfect egg,
with a complete human embryon in its interior3 such
was the doctn'ne of Harvey, Haller, and Bonnet.
It was afterwards contended‚ that every animalcule
in the male semen was a rudimentum homunculi;
and that thousands of them existed in every drop.
Such was the opinion of Ruysch, De Graaf, and
Leuwenhoeck5 who, moreover, asserted that the
human, or any other animal fetus was produced by
a. deposit of some one of these animalcules of the
