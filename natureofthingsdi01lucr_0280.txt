Of this sportive figure Lucretius appears to have
been extremely fond, and it is hence frequently to be
traced in the course of his poem. Our English ὶη.
terpreters‚ however, have none of them attempted
to preserve it in their versions3 but it would be an
injustice to the labours of Marchetti not to men-
tion that, as usual, he has been more attentive to
this characteristic mark of Lucretian versification ι

Ch’ essendo molti primi semi e molti
Communi in molti modi a molti corpi
Mescolati fra lor ι forz' ὲ ch' il vitto
Da varie cose varie cose prendano.

In the same manner, a few lines only above, we
meet with a passage which Ι have endeavoured as
faithfully to translate.
in alternate course
Each flows from each, th’ alternate form is seiz'd,
Th’ alternate nature. Ver. 828.

Dr. Johnson, if 1 rightly remember, in his life of
Gray, strenuously objects to the use of alliterations
of every kind, as stiff, cumbersomc‚ and mechani-
eal. But it should be recollected, that all metre
is mechanism; and that even the style of all prose
writers, who have acquired any degree of celebr-ny,
and especially that of Johnson himself, is mecha-
nism reduced to habit. The

Double, double toil and trouble,

therefore, of which, parodying upon a line of Shake-
spear, he accuses all poets who indulge in this spe-
cies of ornament, will apply to all reputable prose
writers as well 3 but to none more, or even perhaps so
largely as to the accuser. Much true taste, however,
and nice discrimination‚ 1 am ready to allow, is
pceuliarly requisite in the use of the anaphora3

 

and it certainly has, occasionally, been most grossly
abused in the hands of poetasters and punning epi-
grammatists. At the same time, all ages and all
nations afford us instances of its adoption by poets
the most classical and refined. In our own lang-uage
it is well known to be a decoration so commoniti
the writings of Gray, that to quote him would be
altogether an act of superfluity: Mason, who was
his intimate friend and copyist, and who approaches,
perhapS, more nearly to the elegant and impressive
simplicity of Lucretius than any other didactic
poet of whom we can boast‚ has also introduced
this ornament, as he has many other dee-orations
of the Roman bard, and even the contour of those
decorations into his English Garden with no unsparing
hand. Thus in a passage where the author is
proving the frequent necessity of calling in mechanic
skill to our assistance in improving the plan we have
decided upon ;

And where we bid her move, with engine
huge,

Each ponderous trunk, the ponderous trunk there
move.

A work of difficulty, and danger tried.

Nor oft successful found. But if it fail

Thy axe must do its office. Crpel task,

Yet needful. Trust me, tho' I bid thee strike,

Reluctantly I bid thee ; for my soul

Holds dear an ancient oak, nothing more deur,
It is an ancient friend.

Β. i. v. 328.

Thus in a similar manner, Spenser:

Glad of such luck, the Iucky luckless maid
A long time with that savage people staid.

In the following passage of Milton, as well as in
a vast variety of other places, we meet with an in-
stance of both literal and verbal alliteration: and
Lucretius was equally attached to each.

 

So man, as is most just,

Shall satisfy for man, be judged and die, Α
And dying rise, and, rising, with him raise

His brethren ransomed.

Pia. Les-r. iii. 294·
