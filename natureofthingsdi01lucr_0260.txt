DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. I.

Ignis enim foret omnimodis, quodquomque crearet.

Verum, ut opinor, ita est: sunt quaedam corpora, quorum 68 5

Concursus motus, ord0‚ positura, figurae,

Ecficiunt igneis, mutatoque ordine mutant

Naturam: neque sunt igni similata, neque ullae

Praeterea rei, quae corpora mittere possit

Sensibus, et nostros adjectu tangere tactus.

Dicere porro ignem res omneis esse, neque ullam

Rem veram in numero rerum constare, nisi ignem,

Quod facit hicc' idern, perdelirum esse videtur.

Nam contra sensus ab sensibus ipse repugnat,

Et labefactat eOS, unde omnia credita pendent3

Unde hic cognitus est ipsi, quem nominat ignem.

Credit enim sensus ignem cognoscere vere3

Caetera non credit, quae nihilo clara minus sunt:

Quod mihi quom vanum, tum delirum, esse videtur.

Quo referemus enim? quid nobis certius ipsis

Sensibus esse potest? qui vera, ac falsa, notemus ?

other simple substance. This tenet of the Epicurean
philosophy is supposed to have been derived from
Democritus. It was controverted by Aristode and
the Peripatetics‚ who maintained, that there was no
such thing as elementary sire, but that beat was in

every instance produced by commotion of the minute
particles ofthe heated body. This latter tenet,together
with the general philosophy of Aristotle, descendet!
to a very late period of European learning; and
formed a part of the creed of Bacon, Boyle, Des
Cartes and Newton. A more accurate chemical
knowledge, however, has now almost entirely ba-
nished the peripatetic doctrine from the schools of
Europe, and restored to general belief the doctrine
of semina ignis, or elementary sire, so forcibly con-
tendcd for by our poet in this place, but described
