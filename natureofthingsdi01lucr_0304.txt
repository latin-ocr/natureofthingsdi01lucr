Id validis utrum contortum viribus ire,

DE RERUM NATURA.

Lis. Ι.

Quo fuerit missum, mavis, longeque volare3

An prohibere aliquid censes, obstareque, posse ?

Alterutrum fatearis enim, sumasque, necesse est:

Quorum utrumque tibi ecfugium praecludit, et omne

Cogit ut exempta concedas fine patere.

975

Nam, sive est aliquid, quod prohibeat, ecficiatque,

Quo minus, quo missum est, veniat, finique locet se3

Sive foras fertur, non est a fine profectum.

Hoc pacto sequar3 atque, oras ubiquomque locaris

Extremas, quaeram quid telo denique fiat.

Fiet, utei nusquam possit consistere finis 3

chugiumque fugae prolatet copia semper.

Th’ adventurous dart? those bounds would still

resist‚
„ And the keen arrow urge its force in vain.

But if nothing lie beyond this bounded material sys-
tem, then it is bounded by nothing; and if it be
bounded by nothing then, again, has it no bounds
whatever; and of course there would be nothing to
resist the farther flight of the arrow. So that the
force of our poet’s appeal still remains uninvalidated.
The learned Bruno, indeed, in his first Dialogue,
Dell' Infinito Universo, to which Ι havejust referred,
introduces this argument as altogether irrefragable.
In reality, there seems to be no more impiety in at-
taching thev idea of immensity to space, than of end-
less duration to eternity ; and, according to Mr.
Locke, we acquire both ideas in the same manner, and
at the same time. Whilst I am appealing to this ce-
lebrated philosopher, I cannot avoid quoting an il-
lustration of his own in confirmation of this very doc-
trine 3 and which has such a strange coincidence with
his example of an archer placed on the imaginary con-

fines of creation, that it is difficult to avoid conceiving
Mr. Locke had Lucretius in his recollection at the
time of writing it. “ If nour, observes he, be not
supposed infinite, which Ι think no one will affirm,
Ι would ask, whether, if God placed a man at the
extremity of corporeal beings, he could not stretch
his hand beyond his body? If he could, then he
would put his arm where there was before space with-
out body: and if there he spread his fingas, there
would be still space between them without boasy. If
he could not stretch out his hand, it must be because
of some external hindrance: and then I ask, whether
that which hinders his hand from moving outwards be
substance, or accident, something, or nothing ?''

M. Cabanis, however, is a bolder man than any of
the philosopher-s I have yet adverted to. He derives
his idea of ever-y species of existence from sels-motion 3
and he is not afraid of Mr. Locke’s question, ifin-
deed, which I much doubt, he ever met with it.
ἐ· That which opposes me,” says he, ‘⁶ when I move, I
