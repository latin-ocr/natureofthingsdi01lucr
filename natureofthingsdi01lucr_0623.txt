THE NATURE OF THINGS.

If aught remain, then idly must thou (leem

The soul immortal, since diminish'd thus,

And shorn of substance3 but if all escape,

If not an atom lohes—whence, I ask,

Rears the putrescent cmcase, in its womb,

730

The race of worms ? or sport o’er every limb

The boneless, bloodless crowds of things unnam'd ,Ρ

If from without thou deem their souls they draw,

To each a soul entire, unheeding here

What throngs must flock where dwelt but one before,

can a plea of this kind be expected to be admitted in
exculpation of prior guilt before the tremendous

bar of the Almighty‚ whatever be the theory of ma-
ten'alism or immaterialism adopted upon this sub-
Ject.

Ver. 732. The boneless, blooAEess trowds of things
unnam'd ἓ] Thus Bope :

Those half-learn’d witlings‚ numerous in our isle,
As half—form'd insects on the banks of Nile ς
Urfiuish’d things one knows not what to call,
Their generation’s so equivocal.

So, virgil, in describing the production of swarms
of bees from the putrid carcase of a bullock slaugh-
tered and properly prepared for the purpose ε

Sic positum in clauso linquunt ; et ramea
costis

Subjiciunt fragmenta, thymum, casiasque recentes.

Hoc geritur, zephyris primum impellentibus
undas,

Ante novis rubeant quam prata coloribu-z, aare

Garrula quam tignis nidum suspendat hirundo.

Interea teneris tepefactus in ossibus humor

[Estuat : et visenda modis animalia miris,

735

Trunca pedum primo, mox et stridentia pennis
Miscentur, tenuemque magis, magis aera carpunt.
Gnoso. iv. 302.

There leave immm’d, and o’er the carcase spread

Boughs and fresh sweets that thyme and cassia shed.

Thus, all prepar'd, when first young zephyr

⁷ laves

His sportive pinions in the vemal waves,

Ere flowrets blush on earth's enamell'd breast,

Or swallows twitter in their rafter'd nest.

Meanwhile the moisture, with fermenting strife,

Boils in the tender bones, and teems with life 3 ,

First on the sight, all-wondrous to behold,

Forms without feet, a shapeless growth unfold ;

Anon the mingled swarms fer flight prepare,

Buzz on the wing‚ and feel the buoyant air.
So-rflsnv.

Upon the subject os equivoeal generation and
spontaneous vitality‚ its general belief in former pe-
riods, and the observations of modern natum] histo-
rians, which have tended to reviie the doctrine,
and to gire it additional plausibility, sce note on Book
H. 875. The argument of our poet, however, will
herc also, as well as on a former occasion, hold
equally good, whether the system espoused be that
of spontaneozm xitality. or sexxzal gen-:ration alone.
