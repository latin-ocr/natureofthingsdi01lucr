ferred the motion of the former to the latter. And
thus, by fixing the sun in the centre of the planetary
system, by making all the planets revolve around it,
in different orbits, and with different velocities, by
comprehending the orbits of Venus and Mercury
within that of the earth, and throwing those of Mars,
Jupiter, and Saturn beyond it; and, at the same time,
by conceiving thesrevolution of the earth round its
axis from west to east, while this axis remained al-
ways parallel to itself, though inclined, in some de-
gree, to the plane of the earth’s orbit‚ he solved‚ at
once, almost every difficulty which no other system
could solve ; and introduced a theory, plain, simple,
and intelligible‚ in the stead of crude, fanciful, per-
plext, and unsatisfactory hypotheses. Whatever is

Copernicus was convinced of this : he was fearful
of the laugh of some philosophers, and of the hyper-
criticism of others-3 and, probably, foresaw the
anathemas which the bigotry of the Roman church
very shortly afterwards thundered out against his
system: in consequence of which, he kept the entire
plan concealed from the public eye for thirty years
after its invention. At last, in the extremity of old
age, he suffered it to be extorted from him ; but died
as soon as it was printed, and before it was pub-
lished, being, as is generally supposed, terrified to
death at the prospect of a persecution for heresy.

The mode in which the planetary system actually

moves was thus established by the immortal labours
of Copernicus.

But to pursue the history of the experinients and ob-
servations of these, and other philosophers of nearly
the same era, and of high and deserved renovrn,
would occnpy too much space ; and be deviating too
widely from the main scope of these notes. Some farther
information on the same subject, however, as being
more intimately connected with the Epicurean doc-
trines there referred to, will be found in note on ver.
528, Book V. of this poem. I⁴cann0t consent, how-
ever, to suppress the names of those three pre-eminent
labourers in the philosophie vineyard, upon whom
the whole spirit of Newton appears to have been
poured forth after his decease : I mean Clairant,
Euler, and D'Alembert: all of whom pursued the
doctrine of gravitation till they established it as a
principle of universal action: to the two former of
whom we are indcbted for elaborate theories of the
moon, as also of the derangements of Saturn and Ju-
piter3 and to the latter, for the doctrine of the pre-
cession of the equinoxes.

With the astronomic or cosmogonic doctrine ofthe
Hindus and other Oriental nations, we are not at
present much acquainted. Some information, how-
ever, upon this subject, but principally connected
with mythology, may be found in the note on
Book I. v. 865. of this poem, in whichi have ob-
served that the Hindus, in conjunction with the Chi-
nese, conceive the same kind of subtile spirit to
pervade all natural bodies, alid encompass creation,
