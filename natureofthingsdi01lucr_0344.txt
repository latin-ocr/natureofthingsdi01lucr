DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. 11.

Nam ceste non inter se stipata cohaeret

Materies3 quoniam minui rem quamque videmus,

Et quasi longinquo fluere omnia cernimus aevo,

Ex oculisque vetustatem subducere nostris 3

Quom tamen incolomis videatur summa manere3

Propterea, quia, quae decedunt corpora quoique,

Unde abeunt, minuunt3 quo venere, augmine donant:

Illa senescere, at haec contra florescere, cogunt.

Nec remorantur ibei3 sic rerum summa novatur

Semper, et inter se mortales mutua vivunt:

Augescunt aliae gentes, aliae minuuntur3

Inque brevi spatio mutantur secla animantum,

Et, quasi cursores, vita'i lampada tradunt.

mally determined which atoms shall decline, and

which shall persevere ἔ And why, if they decline at
all, may not the declination be several degrees re-
moved from a right line, as well as the minutest de-
gree imaginable ? How, too, does it appear, if there
be any necessity in nature for such declination‚
that the same necessity does not equally prevail among
the declining as among the rectilinear atoms, in
which case all the advantage of the hypothesis is
destroyed in a moment ?'’ These arguments of Ci-
cero, and which Lucretius endeavours to combat‚
have from time to time been copied and re-advanced
'oy every modern philosopher, who has entered the
lists against the disciples of the atomic school of
Epicurus: and they may be traced most fully, and
triumphantly displaycd‚ in the Anti-Lucretius of the

Cardinal Polignac, and the “ Creation” of our own
countryman, Sir Richard Blackmore.

The most able supporter of the atomic school, in
modern times, was Gassendj 3—and‚ sensible of the
weakness of this doctrine of an oscillation of atoms,
and the curvilinear motion which depended upon it,
at the same time convinced of the necessity of some
free and uncontrolled action in nature, whence the
mind obtains that moral liberty of which it appears
conscious——he discarded the invention altogether—
and contended, agreeably to the old hypothesis of
Democritus, that moral spontaneity was obtained
from the difference of velocity with which material
atoms descended; a differ-enee which, in a vast va-
riety of cases, was altogether indefinite, and anoma-
lous. Gassendi was supported in the re-advancement
