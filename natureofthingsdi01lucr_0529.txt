THE NATURE OF THINGS.

Of soul, and reasoning mind 3-—and chase, far chase

Those fears of future torment that distract

{Man’s total being3 with the gloom of death

Tinge all things; nor e'en suffer once the tide

Of present joy to How serene and pure.

For though, full oft, men boast they far prefer

Death to disease‚ or infamy of name,

Assert they know the soul but springs from blood,

enee, he encouraged an indulgence in the enjoyments
it presented : pleasure became his prime object ; and
wherever it was to be traced, he pursued it3 not,
however, the pleasures of the vain, the ambitious, or
the voluptuous; for these, he well knew, carried
with them a sting which poisoned all the gratifica-

tion they presented ; but the pure, satisfactory, and
permanent pleasures of temperance, benevolence, and

the study of nature. His preparation for death, or the
contemplations by which he endeavoured to disarm
it of its terrors, were, in like manner, as different
from those of other philosophers, as his regulations
for the enjoyment oflife. As the latter part of the
book before usis entirely devoted to this subject, itis
unnecessary to enter upon its consideration in this
place. Armed‚ as the Christian is, with an infinitely
better panoply than the arguments of Epicurus can
possibly afford him, he may, nevertheless, pei-use them
with satisfaction, and even improvement : he may add,
to the motives presented to him by Revelation‚ what-
ever can be derived from the suggestions ῳ( nature.

Ver. 46. ——the soal bnt springsfi‘om blood‚] This
was the common belief among all ancient nations:
and those, therefore, who conceived that death was
not a complete termination of existence, were under
the necessity of conceiving‚ at the same time, that
there was some other principle besides the sonl, or
animal life, which constituted a part of the nature of
man. To this effect, we have still remaining a verse
of Empedocles:

Ἀιμα ’γαρ αν9ροπως περικαρδιον, εστι vomax.
The heart’s warm blood in mortals forms the
soul.

On this account, Homer correctly applies to death
the epithet ofpurple, ιιπορφυρεος θανατος, Iliad V. V. 83.
And virgil, imitating him, asserts

Purpuream vomit ille animam, et cum sanguine mista.

ΖΕΝ. ix. v. 349.

Vina refert moriens 3

His purple soul he vomits ; mixt with wine

Back flows the vital fluid as he dies.

The same idea was prevalent among the Jews.
Thus the Almighty is represented as declaring to
Moses, “ the blood is the lfi· of all flesh, the blood of
it is for the [ζῇ the1·eof.¹' Levit. xvii. v. 14. Mil-
ton has borrowed the same idea ; and, in describing

the death of Abel, affirms
he fell, and deadly pale
Groan’d out his saul, withgushing blood gffus’d.

 

Nor is such a belief confined to ancient times, or

menbach and Darwin, have all contendtd, that the

system, becomes itsclf highly am‘nmlizn‘k or, in the too
