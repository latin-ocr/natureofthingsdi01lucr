DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. Ι.

At, rerum quae sunt primordia, plura adhibere

Possunt, unde queant variae res quaeque creari.

Nunc et Anaxagorae scrutemur ὄμοιομερειαν,

830

Quam Graii memorant, nec nostra dicere lingua

Concedit nobis patrii sermonis egestas :

Sed tamen ipsam rem facile est exponere verbis,

Principium rerum, quam dlClt ὅμοιομερειαν·

Ossa videlicet e pauxillis atque minutis

Ossibus, sic et de pauxillis atque minutis

Visceribus viscus, gigni3 sanguenque creari

Sanguinis inter se multis co‘e'untibus guttis t

Ex auraeque putat micis consistere posse

Auram, et de terris terram concrescere parvis3

840

Ignibus ex igneis, humorem humoribUS, esse,

Caetera consimili fingit, ratione, putatque3

Nec tamen esse ulla parte idem in rebus inane

Concedit, neque corporibus finem esse secandis.

Ver. 897. From sapientANiieronAS‚] Thisphi-
Iosopher‚ concerning whose origin there is some dis-
pute among the critics‚ was a native of Clazomenae
in Ionia. Meraphysics, and natural philosophy,
were the continual subjects of his studies3 and he
travelled far with a view of benefiting himself by the
observations of others. He died at the age of 62,
about three centuries and a half before the Christian
aera, at Lampsacus ; to which place he was banished
by the Athenium, in consequence of the aberration
of his philosophie opinions from the popular creed
of the day. His chief preceptor-s were Anaximenes
and Pherecydes; of whom some account will be

found in the notes on v. 765, 766, and 767, of this

book. Plato introduces Socrates as speaking in high
commendation of a work written by Anaxagoras on
Physiology ; and it is probable, that the tenets here
attributed to him were first communicated to the
world in that publication, and that it was hence our
poet imbibed a knowledge of his hypothesis. Plu-
tarch, however, l. i. 13, has informed us, that he was
also the author of a book on The Nature qs Things,
which opens with an assertion, that the divine mind
had produced and arranged every phaenomenon in
nature at one and the same time. Ὁμου vrowa χρηηιατα.
