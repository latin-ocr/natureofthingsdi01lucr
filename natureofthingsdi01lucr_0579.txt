THE NATURE OF THINGS.

To deem the eyes, then, of themselves survey

Nought in existence, while th’ interior mind

370

Looks at all nature through them as alone

Through loop-holeS, is to trifle-—sight itself

The creed absurd opposing every hour.

For oft the eye-ball dares not meet the day,

The flood of light o'erpow'ring: but were eyes

The mind‘s mere loop-holes, toil were never theirs.

Then too, each portal the reflected bearn

Must more obstruet than usher 3—and‚ remov’d‚

Th' exulting mind must drink a double day.

Nor be the sacred doctrine here advanc⁷d

patriarch himself, but by the more nervous and
steady hand of one of his own children.

With grosser body :-] From the account here
given us of the hypothesis of Democritus, it is obvi-

 

ous, that St. Augustin, and even Bayle, who quotes
his words, were both mistaken in conceiving that
this philosopher regarded all primary atoms as equally
animated and intelligent. Democritus, says St. Au—
gustin, “hoc distare in naturalibus quaestionibus ab
Epicuro dicitur, quod iste sentit inesse concursioni
atomorum vim quandam animalem et spirituale1n.''
Hence, says Bayle, in support of his owu opinion,
St. Augustin “ ηί nous permet pas de deuter que De-
