and animates the grosser body. The mind or soul of human beings,
however, as well as of all other animals, xvaS, upon this hypothesis, ca-
pable of quitting the external frame upon its dissolution3 yet it was'
not capable of an indepcnslent existence; it migrated from body to
body, and, after various chyliadS, or thousands of years, returned to its
original frame, in consequence of its resurrection from the grave. Up-
on this theory, the soul of the world gave motion, figure, and phaeno-
mena to itself3 and the earth existed, because it willed to exist, out of
its own substance. It was, in the language of Anaxagoras, an εμῷυχον,
or animated system.

The theory of Plato was, in many points, derived from Pythagoras;
for Socrates, of whom Plato was one os the most distinguished scholars,
was rather a moral and political‚ than a physical or metaphysical phi-
losopher; and hence his creed was either deficient upon the subject of
cosmology, or too simple and irrecondite to satisfy the curiosity of his
pupils. Plato, too, had his trine or triad of essenceS‚ as well as Py-
thagoras and Aristotle3 but, like that of Aristotle, it was evidently
borrowed from Pythagoras. The triad of Plato consisted of an eternal,
intelligent, immaterial Deity; a logos (ὅ >loyca-poc του Θεου) or Divine
Reason, the cternal fountain ofideas, or the exemplars of things; and
matter. The logos, or logismus, the fountain of all forms or ideas,
was in every respect a parallel principle with the duad of Aris-
totle, both being possessed of a similar power, and equally de-
pendent upon the Perfect Enelgy, or Supreme and Eternal
Agent. Matter, however, was not thus dependent3 for it was a prin-
ciple as eternal, incorruptible, and underived, as the immaterial Deity.
It was strangely supposed, however, to be incapable of form or qua-
lity ³¹4, and hencethe necessity of conceiving the existence ofa logos,

³⁸ On this account the tei-ms incorporeal, and immaterial‚ are not synonymous in Platonic writing53
matter itself being incorporeal, or without form or body, till associated with the divine exemplar or logos :
a distinction necessary to be attended to in the study of the Academic hypothesis.
