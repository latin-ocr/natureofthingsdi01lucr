Ver. 532. Come, thm, while thus, in short, but
sweetest verse,] Gassendi, in his commen-
tary on this part of our poet, contends‚ that this,
and the three following verses, should be omitted, as
irrelevant to the subject. The connexion, however, l
think, is obvious, and the verses themselves are possest
of no small beauty. Iudependently of which, if every

the end, we should not have a single line left of ac-
knowledged originality. Lucretius has suffered too
much from such fauciful alterations already.

their beasts inclosed with elephants’ trunks. Polyb.
