Boon ΙΙΙ. THE NATURE oF THINGS. 5:31

< Thou! who in sleep devourest ha'lf thy days?
And, e’en awake, who snorest, *dreaming still, 108 5
And tort’fing all thy mind with vain alarms ?
Thou! who lamente'st, oft, unknowing why,v
Urg’d on, with fear intoxicatecl deep,
And in a maze of mental errors lost Ρ
Did men but think, and oft to think they seem, 1090

And knew they too whence thus themselves create
These bosom suff’rings—seldom should we see
Life spent as now each passing honr pourtrayS.
All pant perpetual for they know not what, 1095
Nor leam by searching-—Changing their abodes,
As though the change would leave their load behind,
This, from mete listlessneSS‚ his mansion Hies ζ.
