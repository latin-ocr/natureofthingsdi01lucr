Sensiferos motus, quaedam quei mente volutant.

Quarta quoque hiis igitur quaedam natura necesse est

Adtribuatur z ea est omnino nominis expers :

Qu& neque mobilius quidquam, neque tenuiuS, exstat,

Nec magis est parvis et laevibus ex clementis ; 2 45

Sensiferos motus quae didit prima per artus:

Prima cietur enim, parvis perfecta figuris ;

Inde calor motus, et venti caeca potestas,

Adcipit3 inde a'e‘r: inde omnia mobilitantur :

concutitur sanguiS, tum viscera persentiscunt

no name by which to express such a science: it
was, on the contrary, a subject they sedulously
cultivated, both as a brauch of philosophy, and an
object of trade. In the advance of the present poem,
the reader will meet with various proofs of the truth
of this observation; see, especially, notes on Book
IV. ν. 327, and 10463 and many more might be
easily adduced in the present note, if 1 had not al-
ready extended it to too great a length. Those,
who are desimus of pursuing the, subject, may ad-
vantageously consult an Italian work, printed at
Parma in 1799, in seven volumes quarto, entitled
“Dell’Origine‚ Progressi, e Stato attuale d’ogni Litte-
ratura‚” by the abate D. Giovan. Andres, who has
examined this topic with a large share of erudstion,
and, in his fifth volume, quotes from a very curious
and valuable manuscript in St. Mark's library at
Venice, which contains a list of the Greek chemists,
and the characters they employed. The date of
this MS.. it appears, is uncertain, but it affords in-
controvertible proofs of a high antiquity.

The conception, by Epicurus, of a gass similar to
the oxygenou3‚ or galvanic‚ is not more wonderful

than that by Nicetus of Syracuse, and several Pytha*
gorean philosophers, to whose conjectures 1 have al-
ready adverted‚ of many of the most important prin-
ciples of the Copernican theory ς such, for example,
as that the sun is situated in the centre of the solar
system, the rotation of the earth on her axis, and
her annual revolution around the central fire: that
her sliape is spheroidal, and admits of antipodes;
and that the moon, and other planets, are habitable.
But what will the unlearned reader say, when he
finds that even the meteoric stones, or those which
are now traced to have fallen from the heavens,
and are at this moment, for thefitst time, as is com-
monly supposed, exciting great attention in the phi-
losophie world, are not a new discovery, and were
known to mankind upwards of four hundred years
before the birth of our Saviour ; were as differently
accounted for by the sages of that early aera, as they
are in our own day; and their fall capable of being
foretold by some of them, and especially by Anaxa-
goras, who predicted the descent of a very large
stone that fell accordingly on the banks of the AEgos
in Thrace. This fact and prediction are equally re-
