DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. ΙΙ.

Scire licet gigni posse ex non sensibus sensus,

Quod, si forte aliquis dicet, dum taxat oriri

Posse a non sensu senSUS, mutabilitate,

Ante, aliquo tamquam partu,

quam proditur extra ;

Huic satis illud erit, planum facere, atque probare,

Non fieri partum, nisi concilio ante coact03

Nec quidquam conmutari sine conciliatu

 

fervent exanima putri
De bove 3 mille animas una necata dedit. Flsr. i.

The putrid carcase now ferments amain,
And thousands spring to life for one that’s slain.

Ver. 952. But fivm the sympathy qs primal seedr :]
The more minutely we become acquainted with the
operations of nature, the more clearly we perceive, that
in her physical as well aa her moral department, there
exist certain inexplicable sympathies and antipa-
thies which no cxci-tion of man can possibly destroy.
Gravitation itself may be adduced as an instance of
general sympathy pervading every particle of matter,
and compelling it to associate for the common good.
The operation of the magnet upon iron, or their
mutual desire of approximation, may be regarded as
a particular sympathy ε so also may the power of
mctallic substances to attract the electric aura. But
as the attachment of this subtle fluid to metals at
large appears stronger in every instance than its at-
tachment to any other kind of substance, so does it
seem to give a preference to some metals beyond
what it discovers toward others: while, in the mean
time, it evinces an insurmountable antipathy to silk,
wax, glass, and all similar substances ; the degree of
antipathy towards one substance exceeding that to-
wards another. The philosophy of chemistry un-
folds this doctrine in a light still more conspicuous :
and while it opens to us substances which will never
combine, and between which there appears to sub-
sist an eternal and insuperable dislike, it presents us
also with substances attached to each other by every

possible degree of affinity and elective attraction. Che-
mistry discovers to us, that oil will unite with alcohol,
but not with water3 that alcohol will unite with
water, ⁸but not with alkali: that there is a sym-
pathy, affinity, or elective attraction between water
and calcareous carths, which enables the former to
embrace, or dissolve in its pores, a definite quantity
of the latter: that there is a stronger affinity be-
tween calcareons earths and acids, since a larger
quantity will here bc absorbed in proportion to the
aeid employed3 while the menstruum, at the same
time, remains limpid: and that again, there is an
affinity far stronger than either, between acids and
alkalis, which may literally be said to destroy each
other by their embraces: and hence, when a due
proportion of alkali is added to an aeid, in which
calcareous earth has been previously dissolved, the
aeid will immediately take hold of the alkali in pre-
ference to the earth; its former connexion will be relin-
quished‚ andthe calcareous solvend will be precipitated
to the bottom of the vessel. It is impossible, in-
deed, to pul-sue this subject, to notice the different.
elective attractions and repulsione, in many instances
duplicated, and even triplicated‚ that chemistry un-
folds to us, without being astonished at the faculties
exhibited throughout the whole world of brute, un—
animated matter.

From unanimated matter these peculial· and my-
sterious affections ascend to vegetable life, and dis-
play to us germs, molecules, and fibrils, uniting‚ not
at random with germS, molecules, and fibrils‚ but
each selecting the other, the female the male, and
