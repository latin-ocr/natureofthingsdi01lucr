. Sir thmAM Tnom’son's special work in,

science occupies him in 9 region where it 19 rather
difficolt for men of merely ordinary culture to follow
in his footsteps. rJJhe higher departments of elec-
111091 and magnetio speculation, where scientifio
exploret-s 01· 1119 eminence are engaged, are fields in
which 1999 advanced studente soon lose their way,
and grew bewildered. ‘rhei-0 will, probably, be few
persons outsIde a limited circle who will be able to
realise the fimportanoo of those researchee in
terrestrial magnetism in which he describes Sir
Enwsnn Samum 99 engaged, and in which he
touches 90 nearly on great results. But there is
= one passage in the present addi-ess that will be more
readily comprehended, and in which new specula-
tione are contributed to 9 branch of scientific 111-
, vestigation which has taken a strong hohi of

late on the popular fancy. Sir WILLIAM
Tnoursou has out-Darwined Dfflwm in his
coniecturee concerning the origin ot life on
Ἴ this planet. Peremptorily rejecting 911 theories
, οἱ spontaneoue generation, the new Pre-
sident declares his firm belief that under no cir-
cumstances has life been evolved from meteoro-
logical conditione of inanimato matter. When the
world first settled into shape and cooled down on the
sui-face sufficiently to tolerate vegetable and
animal existence, Sir WILLIAM holds it to

have been impossible—in opposition to 1111ἶ

scientifie knowledge —to suppose that life
