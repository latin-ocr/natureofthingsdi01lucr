ΤΗΕ NATURE OF THINGS. 553

With utmost toil, a scant, and puny race.

For dcem not thou some golden chain from heav'n

Each tribe conducted down to realrns below;

Nor from the boist’rous billows of the main

That mortals sprung: earth from herself produc’d

The various ranks that still herself sustains.

Trojan contest, although the Greeks were at this
moment discomfited, and on the point of ruin. “ It
was impossible for thee‚'’ says he, ‘⁶ to have sprung
from Thetis and the noble Peleus, but rather,

Some rugged rock’s hard entrails gave thee form,
And raging scas produc'd thee in a storm 5—
So rough thy manners. Pon.

γλαυκη δε σε τικτε Sanno-m

Πετροιι τ’ megaron, ὁτι τοι νοος εστιν σιπηνης. IL. Π. v. 34.

A conception which Virgil has imitated with much
felicity in his AEneid, Book IV. v. 365.

Frachetta, however, in his Italian exposition, as
well as our own learned countryman Mr. Wakefield,
has a different conjecture, and supposes the poet to re-
fer to the philosophie system of Thales, who main-
tained that all things were produced from water : of
which system, as well as of our poet’s opposition to it,
some account has already been given in Book I. ver.
785, and the note belonging to it.

These conjectures are both ingenious and elegant,
but to me they are not sufficiently satisfactory. As
to the former, no one in the time of Lucretius, or
indeed, at any other time, could possibly believe
that Homer meaned to represent Achilles as having
actually arisen from the stormy sea : and to suppose,
therefore, the present verses designed to resist such
an opinion, is to suppose thern designed to fight with

“ the air, and to resist an opinion that never was enter-

tained. The latter conjecture is entitled to superior
attention ; but no reason is offered by the learned com,
mentatum, and Ι suspect none can be offered, why
the poet should advert once more to this opinion of
Thales, rather than to those of Heraclitus, Anaxime—

systerns our poet has equally before discussed, and
endeavoured to subvert.

Following up the popular mythology to which hc
manifestly adverts‚ in his first instance, of a gollim
chain, he much rather appears to me to have that part
of the same mythology in view which represents the
gods at large, the creators or progenitors of man-
kind, and consequently mankind themselves, as ori-
ginally produced from this element : an opinion which
we know was held, from the following address of
Juno to Venus :

Ειμι γαρ οῴομενη πολυφορβου πειρατα ‘young

Ὠκεανον τε θεων ’γενεῦ-ιν, και μητερα Tutior,

Οἳ μ’ εν σφων-ι :lupono-w ενα-τεφον ηδ’ omnum.

Ιι. Ξ. 201.

For lo ! I haste to those remote abodes,

Where the great parents, sacred source of gods,

ocean and Tethys, their old empire keep,

On the last limits of the land and deep.

In their kind arms my tender years were pass’d.

Pors.

Or, which is nearly the same thing, Lucretius may,
in these verses, allude to the birth of Venus indivi-
dually ε Venus, who was the immediate parent of
the Roman people, and ,who‚ with more appropria-
tion than any of thc deities besides, may have been
said, upon the vulgar mythology of the day, to have
arisen from the ocean, the fluctus p.'anger1tes saxa,
‘⁵ the boisterous billows of the main,’¹ as lie expresses
himself in the very passage under consideration :
this goddess, who was the life of all life, and the de-
light of gods and men: under all which characters
our poet has represented her in his invocation at the

nes, Oenopides, or any other philosophers, whose opening of the first book.
