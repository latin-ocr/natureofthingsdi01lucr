THE NATURE OF TIIINGS.

18ss

Contending hosts, and hear the clash of war!

But sweeter far on VVisdom’s heights serene,
Upheld by Truth, to fix our firm abode3
To warch the giddy crowd that, deep below,

For ever wander in pursuit of bliss ;

10

To mark the strife for honours, and renown,

For wit and wealffi, insatiam, ceaseless urg'd,

Day after day, with labour unrestrain’d.

O wretched mortals l—-race perverse and blind !

Wrapt in a cloud, on Atlas propt secure,
To watch far off, the busy throng that toil,
Bereft of reason.

To the same effect, and from the same source,

the pensive Muse of Cowper:

’Tis pleasant through the loop-holes of retreat

To peep at such a world. To see the stir

Of the great Babel, and notfeel the crowd.

To hear the roar she sends through all her gates
At a safi distance, where the dying sound

Falla a soft murmur on th’ uninjur'd ear.

Thus sitting, and surveying thus at ease,

The globe and its concerns, I seem advanc‘d

To some secure, and more than mortal height. Tasx.

Statius has, therefore, compared to the sage him-
self this secure and elevated cliff, on which Lucre-
tius and Cowper represent him as seated τ

Stat sublimis apex, ventosque imbresque serenus

Despicit. ΤΗΕΒ. ii. 35.

Firm stands its brow sublime, and winds and
showers

Despises, fearless.

Itis highly probable that from this passage of Sta-
tius Goldsmith derived his beautiful and parallel simile ;
which, in reality, is little more than a free translation ε

As some tall cliff that lifts its awful form,

Swells from the vale, and midway leaves the storm,

7

Though round its head the rolling clouds arc
spread,
Eternal sun-shine settles on its head.

Desearssn VittAor.

Mr. Sotheby, in his version of Wieland's Oberon,
has given us the same idea, almost in the same words ι

Sublimely rais’d to Heaven, his brow appears
The shrine of peace ς and like a sun-gilt height,
Vv'here never earthly mist obscur'd the light,
Above the stormy world, its tranquil summit
rearS. Cam. viii.

The beauty of this description is, however, the
translator-’s own: for the rendering is so wide of the

original that it is barely possible to trace the clue.
In Wieland it occurs as follows:

-—verschlossen der begier,
Von keiner fureht, von keinem schmerz betrofsen‚
Ist nur dem wahrem noch die heitre seele offen,
Nur offen der natur, und reingestimmt zu ihr.

Ver. 1 1 . To mark the strifisor honours, and renown,
For wit and wealth, insatiate——jl In a simi-

lar manner, Denham describes the various pursuits of
our own metropolis, from the brow ofCooper’s Hill :

Its state andnwealth, its business and its crowd,
Seem, at this distance, but a darker cloud ;
And is, to him who rightly things esteemS,
No other in effect than what it seems.
