*THE NATURE OF THINGS.

There, nor pain pervades,

23

Nor danger threatens3 every passion sleeps3

Vice no revenge, no rapture virtue prompts.

sNot thus Mankind, Τ hem long the tyrant power
Of·SUPERST1T10N sway'd, uplifting proud

Her head to heaven, and with horrific limbs

Brooding o'er earth3 till he, the man of Greece‚

Auspicious rose, who first the combat dar'd‚

And broke in twain the monster’s iron rod.

has translated the passage more accurately‚ and forms
the only exception to the remark just made, among
the interpreters in our own language.

Whilst sometimes human lise dejected lay
On earth, under gross superstition's sway.

The Baron de Coutures, in his French version, has
also adopted the term ; and Voltaire, in adverting to
the incident which comprises the episode that im-
mediately follows, and whose verses the' reader will
find quoted in the note on ver. 110 of this book,
with perhaps more emphasis still, has employed the
term fanaticism; a passion which he correctly per-
sonifies, and represents as the unnulural offspring of
religion, the immediate source of every barbarous and
inhuman rite. Henriade, chant. v.

Epicurus,—the founder of the sect of philosophers
who were called by his name, and whose system forms
the subject of the present poem. This great and
virtuous man has been more unjustly calumniated than
perhaps any man that ever existed. The purity of
his moral precepts were unexceptionable3 and his
own mode of living, instead of having led, as it is
generally represented, to every species of impiety and
debauchery, was uniformly coincident with them,

 

and hence at all times most chaste and temperate.
His attachment to his country was most ardent 3 and
his piety most exemplary. In life, and in death, he
was a pattern well worthy the imitation of mankind
in every age and country. Epicurus was born in the
109th olympiad, the 3d year from the death of Plato.
He was, as we learn from Diogenes, the son of Neocles
and Choerestrata, of the illustrious family of the
Philaides at A·thens. At the age of eighteen, he
commenced his philosophie studies in this renowned
city, about the era of the death of Alexander, and
the meridiari life and splendour of Xenocrates and
Aristotle. Having acquir-ed a high celebrity for in-
telligence and profound rescarch, lie instituted at
Athens, when about the age of thirty, a new
school, and propounded to crowded audiences hfs
own more simple system. For the great outlines
of this he was indebted to Leucippus and Democritus,
the oldest philosophers of the atomic class. Many
of the principles of these earlier sages, however, he
totally discarded; and added, at the same time, se-
veral to the original system. For a farther account
of his life, his frugality, and virtue, I refer the reader
to the biography of Lucretius prefixed to this poem.
Epicurus died of an inflammation from a stone in the

bladder, in the 127th olympiad, and the 7zd year of
his age. ’
