THE NATURE OF THINGS.

T h’ effusive sun, as with a garment‚ deck ’

With his own radiance‚ all‘created things3

Instant in speed, unbounded in his blaze.

But the bright fluid, the pure stream he throws,

Flows not without resistance3

many a wave,

Through space profound‚ etherial checks its Hight3

And many a self—engender'd power perverse,

Rear'd from its complex frames: perpetual hence

160

Lags the light fluid‚ doom'd to double strife.

But primal atmm, firm and solid sole

From pure simplicity, when through void space

Free and uncheck’d their easy course they wing,

One in themselves, at once their goal attain.

Hence than the rapid light more rapid still

Sir Richard' Blackmore has likewise attempted an
imitation of the same passage 3 but he is much more
feeble than Cowley ε

How soon the sun-beams at the morning’s birth
Leap down from heaven, ancl light upon the earth !
Prodigious flight Ξ they in few moments pass

The vast etherial interposing space. Cum. b. iv.

I have said, that these verses of Lucretius are ini-

mitable: perhaps the following are the nearest that
approach them :

See heaven its sparkling portals wide display,
Ami break upon thee in aflood qs day ,Ι ,
Pops’s Mess.

Ver. 166. Hence than the rapid light more rapitl still
Rush they, ] It was not possible for Lu-
cretius to have selected a more pertinent illustration

 

of the speed with which the minutest atoms of mat-
ter may move, than by referring us to the phaenome-
non of light: the particles of which, although in·
conceivably minute, bear, however, no imaginable
proportion, in point of subtlety, to these primal cor-
puscles. By referring us, moreover, to an acknow-
ledged fact, he gains this additional advantage-that
we must admit it to be possible for myriads of bodies
to be moving‚ with incalculable velocity‚ around us,
although we be not apprized of such motion, or even
of their existence, by any Qf the senseswe possess.
Aristotle, and his sollowem, denied this corporiety of
light, and of course, that it had any velocity‚ or
could possibly move in time or space. See his trea- '
tise‚ De Anima, l. ii. And Frachetta, the Italian
expositor of Lucretius, who had imbibed all the doc-
trines of the Peripatetic school, and was rivetted to
