intelligencc, reason seems, on the contrary, rather to point out to
us the possibility os an equal crcation out of nothing of ten thousand
other substances, of which each may be the medium of lit'o and hap-
piness to infinite orders of beings, while every one may, at the same
time, be as distinct from every one, as the whole may be from matter,
or as matter is from what, without knowing any thing farther of, we
commonly denominate spirit. spirit, as generally used among modern
metaphysicians, is, to say the most of it, buta mere negative term,
employed to express something that is not matter; but there may be
ten thousand sometffings, and substrata of being, and moral excellence
and felicity, which are not matter, none of which, however, we can
otherwise characterise. Yet why, between all, or any one of these,
and matter itself, there should be such an utter opposition and discre-

must indispensably consist of the essence of some one of the orders of

beings whom he has created. Why may it not be as distinct from that
of an arehangel, as from that of a morta} ? from the whole of those va-

rious substances, which I havejust supposed, and which we cannot
otherwise contemplate, or characterise, than by the negative term spi-
rit, as itis from matter which is more immediately submitted to our
eyes, and constitutes the substratum of our own being and sensa*
tions ?

But I return to the subject before me: and repeat it, that my in-
tention, instead of defendiug the erroneous doctrine of Epicurus re-
specting the eternity of matter, has been merely to prore that, in err-
ing, he only erred with the greater part of the world at large, and
upon a point which it would be absurd and (logmatic to affirm is pos-
