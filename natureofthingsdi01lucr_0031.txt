PREFACE. xvii

I pretend not that they admit of comparison; and could it once bo
deinonstrated, that the pursuits are inconsistent with each other, Ι would
shut up Lucretius for ever, and rejoice in the conflagration of thr·
Alexandrian library. Having thus occasionnlly extended my rescarclws
und resemblances to the Hebrew, the readcr must excuse nic, is, froin
a love of Asiatic poetry, I sometimes lead him into the sister languanes
of Arabia and Persia: yet, I trust, he will seliloin have to repent of
his ,joui-ney, or return without an adequate recompense sor its distance

and fatigue.

To the general work, Ι have prefixed a biography ot' our poet.
Those, I have hitherto met with, are little more than dry catalogue>-
of dates and names, unintercsting in narrative, barren in facts, and
questionable in chronology. I have pursued a different plan, have
presented Lucretius, as far as I have been able, in the circle othis
connexioms, delineated him from his own writings, analysed the doc-
trines he professed, and defended him from the attacks of nialevolence
and ignorance. In a subjoined Appendix, Ι have given a comparative
statement of the rival systems of philosophy that fiourished in his own
aera ε have followed them, in their ebbs and flows, through succeeding
generations, and identified their connexion with various theories of the
present day. At the end of the work is added a copious, and, Ι trust,
a useful Index.

Ι have thus put the reader into possession of his bill of fare, aud
may perhaps be allowed to hope, without vanity, that he will not be
dissatisfied with the entertainment provided for him. ‘⁶‘ A good book,’'
says an elegant writer of our own times, ‘⁶ is a creatiom a good
translation, a resurrection *Γ In the present instance, the creation is
indisputable‚ the resurrection remains yet to be proved.
