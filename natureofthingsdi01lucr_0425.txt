THE NATURE OF THINGS.

VVeaving enfuriate, charm’d with human blood,

And madly §haking their tremendous crests.

These picture, haply, the DicrAEAN train,

Alike CURETES term’d, as fame reports,

Who drown’d the infant eries of JovE in CRETE,

To the whole of this tradition Callimachus refers
to in his hymn to Jupiter:

Ουλα δε Κουρῆτες σε περι, προλιν ωρχησ-οιυτο,
Τευχεα πεπληγοντες, ινα Κρονος ovone-w πχην

L. 52.

Thee the Curetes, when a babe, conceal'd

With close commingl'd dance, and clashing shield ;
Thus striking loud their arms o’cr Satum’s ear
To drown thine infant cries of grief and fear.

The origin of this fable is thus developed upon
Mr. Bryant's system: From Da-Meter, or the
deified earth, “the common mother of gods and
inen,’' Saturn proceeded, as her first-born offspring.
But Saltum, as his name imports‚ is a type, either
of Ether itself‚ or tlie ethereal fires, as the sun,
moon, and stars; and differs not essentially from the
Greek Ουμνος, which is litei-ally, “ the heavens.’'

In process of time, however, Saturn is seigned to
have married the deified Γης, or Da-Meter3 and from
this junction proceeded jupiter. But Xuth, or
Xuth-P’-Ait-Or‚ (Jupiter) ‘⁶ the temple of inspira-
tion of the radiant Xuth-‚” or “ Xuth, the sun‚’'
was, undoubtedly, an arkite deity; and so precisely
accords, as he is described by Herodotus, with
Noah or Osiris, that there can be no doubt of both
being the same person. Xuth, Jupiter, or Osiris,
was, therefore, the male deity, and supreme object
of arkite idolatry‚ as Isis, Aphrodite, or Venus, was
the female. The Curetes (Cur-Ait-Es, ‘⁴ most il-
lustrious luminaries,'') here spoken of as the compa-
nions or educators of Jupiter, were so many priests
minister-ing to him as the arkite deity: and the re-
mainder of the fable, which asserts the strong incli-
nation of Saturn to destroy and devour him, and
that these Curetes surrounded and defended‘ him

with their sh‘ields, imports a contest between the
idolatry of the sun, and that of the ark, at a period
when the latter was either in a state of infancy‚ or ax.
a low ebb 3 and the vigour with which its cause was
espoused by its priests and votaries: a vigonr, in-
deed, whjch, according to the prosecution of the
sable, was eventually crowned with the complete-st
success. For we are told, that Jupiter, or the arkite
deity, at length, overcame Saturn, or the solar deity,
and banished him from Heaven‚ affording a type of
the triumph of the arkite worship, or the religion of
Isis and Osiris in Egypt3 from which country, there
can be no doubt that the Helladians derived the
whole of this story.

The fable of Saturn’s devouring his own offspring ·
is, however, highly beautiful, if considered under
another and a more obvious allegory. Sanun, or
Chronos, was the first-born of Cybele, or the Dea-
Mater‚ and the great parent os all beings‚ whether
gods or men. As Chronos, he was also the sun
himself, the prime fountain of light and beat, which
his name immediately implies:-Chronos (l-lp)
meaning nothing more than irradiation, or ether-ealfire.
According to the systems of most of the ancient, as
well as most of the modern philosophers, the cor-
ruption or destruction of one thing is but the gene-
ration of another 3-and the heat of the sun destroys
what its heat has also brought to perfectiori. The
great luminary, and original fountain of all things,
was hence allegorically represented as devouring liis
own offspring. The allegory became, in process of
time, a part of popular mytholog-53 and human sa-
crifices were offered to him in Crete, Carthago, :ind
Latium, as also in every other country in whnh ln>
worship prevailcd. See note on- Book Ι. 322.
