Boon ΠΙ. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 479

And puny system, since most surely then

Doom'd to destruction 3 by the change sustain'd

Shorn of its vigour, and interior sense.

Why, if endear'd not by one common birth,

Thus should it pant in equal hour to reach 78 5

Perfection with the body? or, revers’d,

Why long for freedom when the frame decays ?

Fears, then, the soul confinement after death

Mid the foul members ? or the dang’rous fall

Of its own tott'ring mansion? But, reflect, 790

What lives immortal, danger ne'er can know.

What, too, so idle, as that souls should throng

Round each vile intercourse, or beast that bears :

Immortal souls! contesting who shall first

Enter the feeble fetus; if, perchance, 795

This not decides them, and all strife precludes,

That who first gains it, claims a prior right.

Trees not in ether, not in ocean clouds,

Nor in the fields can fishes e'er exist3

of the sexes, of whatever kind it may be, in forming
a soul for the occasion. The commentator upon
Creech's translation, finding himself driven to the
dilemma of assenting to the one or the other of these
hypotheses», has chosen the latter. Upon a proposal
of the same argument by Dr. Prieetley to Dr. Price,

in their printed discussion of this subject, Price pre-
ferred to evade the question altogether. In the case
of the souis of brutes, however, the commentator
upon Creec’n contends for their being immaterial, but
not immortal. See note in Crecch's translation,

Book 111. ver. 797.
