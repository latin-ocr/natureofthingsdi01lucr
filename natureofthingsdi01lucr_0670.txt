DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. 111.

Quod memorant, laticem pertusum congerere in vas3

Quod tamen expleri nulla ratione potestur.

Ver. 104 5. This, or I err, thefable well uffolds,
Fcign’d ofthe damsels, διε. ] It is re-
ported, in fabulous history, that Danaus, king of
the Argives, had fifty daughters, who were married
to the fifty sons of AEgysthu8‚ the brother of Da-

 

n'a'ns; and that forty-nine out of these fifty sisters,
for Hypermnestra could not be prevailed upon to
unite in the plot, acccded to the barbarous proposal
of their father, and massacred their husbands on the
bridal night. Popular mythology represents them
as sentenced, in consequence of so inhuman a crime,
to the dreadful abodes of hell; and condemned to
toil for ever, in filling a leaky vessel with water,
which escapzd as fast as it could be poured in.

This fable is stated, by the Bryantine hypothesiS,
to be of Chaildean or Egyptian origin; and to re-
fer to the arkite worship propagated over Greece by
some of the wandering Cushite colonies, after their
desei-tion of the plain of Shinar, or the valley of
Goshen. I have formerly observed, see note on
Book Il. v- 1167‚ that Mr. Bryant conjectured
Danaus, literally, Da—Naus, “ the ark or ship,'’ to
have been the same person with Noah,—the machine
he had constructed, being called, as is customary
even in modern days, after his own name. In con-
sequence of which, from Noah or Naus, which is
the same »voi-d with a Greek termination‚ is derived
an appellation for every similar vessel in most of the
languages of Europe. Thus, in Greek, Nouum
Latin, Navi53 French‚ Navire; Spanish and Por-
tuguese, Navi63 Italian, Navigio.

But Danaus, it seems, was the brother of AEgys-
theus, which, upon the same system, is Ai-C-Es-
Theus, and, with the common Ionic contraction,
meniis-Thetis, “the place of the temple of the
glorious Tiieusss’ Theos, or Thoth, however, as
I have already observed in the above note, was
an appellarim, among the Chaldeans, for the Cre—
ator, or deity supremely ador-ed3 and when the
idolatrous descendants of Ham first transferred the
worship of the true God to the Sun, the Serpent,
the mk, and the builder of the Ark, Noah was

also denominated Theuth, Xuth, or Zuth‚ whence
both Ζευς and Θεος; whence, also, Διος and Deus,
and many other parallel terms both in ancient and
modern languages- See note as above on Book II·
v. 1167.

The tfflnity here specified, therefore, as subsist-
ing between Dan'zius and AEgysthuS, and fabulously
denominated a braiher-hood, is easily accounted for.
by conceiving the two terms to refer to an hypothe-
sis of Noah, and the Temple or hierarchy instituted
to his honour. If this be admitted, it is easy to
conceive, that the fifty sons and the fifty daughters
were so many priests and priestesses employed in the
idolatrous worship. And the marriage and barba-
rous plot here stated to have ensued, may refer to
some fresh vow, mutually entered into, of additional

superstition, together with the sudden¹ breaeh of
that vow, on the part of many of the votaries, as
soon as it had been consummated, and their deser-
tion to the worship of the Sun, the Sei-pent, or
some other deity. The name of Hypermnestra, the
only female who refused to comply with the dishonest
proposal of the sisterhood is almost literally, Hyp-
Ur-Mcnes-Tar-A, and, with a Dor-ic contr-action,
Hyp-Ur-M'nes-T’r-A: once more signifying, as
though conferred distinctively upon herself, in con-
sequence of her peculiar fidelity, “ the place of the
ark of the prosound and illustrious Noah.'' On the
the word Hyp, (gn-1 among the Egyptians,) 1 have
already commented in note on Book ΙΙ. v. 1167, and
have there sluwn, that it was the express and direct
term for a boat, barge, or ship3 and‘the word by
which the ark of Noah, or Thoth‚ was described
when these names were not figuratively selected for
the purpose. And it is curious to observe, that
almost every European language. which has not
derived its appellation for a water-carriage from the
Chaldean term Noah, has been indebted to this ad-
ditional radical. Hence the Greek ‘Im-o,- applied,
first of all, to ships and water-carriages, which were
beautifully and poetically denominated horses of
Neptune, and afterwards transferred to horses of
