danced before Jehovah with all his might.''

lh the beautiful oriental story of Dushwanta,
and Sacoontala‚ whence the poet Chalidas drew
the subject for his Fatal Ring, a drama which Sir
william Jones has elegantly translated from the
Sanscreet, we meet with a similar procession. Dush—
wanta was on the road that led to the recluse habita·
tion ofthe spotless Sacoontala: “ He departed,” says
the historiari, “ under the escort ofa numerous army,
composed of horse and font, of elephants and cha—
riots ς he marched along, amid the shouts of the sol-
diem, resembling the roaring of lions, the clangor of
the shell or trumpet, the rattling of chariot-wheels,
&c. As the king was passing, there was a buz of
applause. The women, anxious to behold their
prince, in all the exalted splendour of majesty, stood
upon the tops oflofty terraces-—they ⁴shonted forjoy,
and a shown· asflowrrs was sprinkled down upon his

Eut the Phrygian danee, here referred to, seems to
be chiefly imitated, or, perhaps, only retained, in all
its extravagance, on the annual return of the Hindu
festivity of ablution in tha waters of the Ganges.

idea forms a part of the well-known description of
Hector, when about to embrace his infant son, who
immediately clung to his nurse's bosom :

Satura, in consequence of the decree of the Fater», that
he should be dethroned and expelled his kingdom
by one of his sone, was accustomed, according to the
Greek mythologistS, to destroy and devour them as
soon as they were born, intending hereby to frustrate
the determination of the Fates themselves. Rhaea,
Cybele, or the Mater Idaea of Lucretius, sor she had
an infinite variety of names, was the wife of Saturn,
and was delivered of Jupiter in the island of Crete;
whose hfe she endeavoured to preserve stom the bar-
barous custom of her husband, by concealing him, at
first, in a secret and retired cave, and afterwards, by
entrusting him to the care of six brothers of his own
age, nan-‚ed Curetes, whom she designed for, and after-
wards actually made, priests to herself. These compa-
nions of the infant Jupiter she instmcted‚ at all times,
to encompass him, and drown his eries with their
clasln'ng shields, or the music of their cymbals3 on
which last instrument they had been already taught
to perform, whenever Satnrn was at hand, and hunt—
ing for the young divinity.
