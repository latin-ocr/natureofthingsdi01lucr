THE NATURE OF TIIINGS.

When thunder sends the skies, though wide it dart,

Now here, now there, amid the rushing rain,

Its forky fires-—spends its chief strength on earth. 2 20

This, too, regard intent ε that primal seeds,

&Vhen down direct their potent path they urge,

In time uncertain, and uncertain space,

Oft from the right decline-‘yet so minute.

Veer they, no fancy less can e'er conceive.

without this devious curve primordial seeds

Would drop successive, like the crystal show'r,

Bolts of loud thunder, floods of lightning rend
Th' opening skies, and into earth descend. HAYLEY.

The passage answering to this, and the four follow-
ing verses, and comprizing the same number of lines
in the original, is dispatched in two verses alone in
Creech’s translation, and is of course most incorrectly
and unfaithfully rendered. It is given thus:

Now seeds in downward motion must decline,
Though very little from th' exactest line.

He has totally omitted, as his commentator has

justly observed, the
incerto tempore ferme

 

 

Incertisque locis
In time uncertain, and uncertain space

of Lucretius, though an expression of the utmost
consequence in the position advanced‚ and on the
imagined truth of which all its advantage ‹lepends.
The version of Marchetti is far more accurate in this
respect:

improvement, as he appnehemied, upon the old atomic
philosophy, chiefly for the purpose of accounting for
the moral liberty of intelligent beings ε although he
likewise commended, that from such oscillation alone
proceeded the greater part of the conjunctions, uni—
ons, and adhesions of atoms to atoms ; which, if the
whole descended in a path strictly rectilinear, could
not often take place, and of course the world
not exist, as at present. “ Deinde,'’ observes Cicero,

deorsum e regione ferrentur, et, ut dixi, ad lineam,
nunquam fore ut atomus altera alteram posset attin-
gere: itaque attulit rem commentitiam : declinare
dixit atomum perpaulum, quo nihil posset fieri minus.
Ita effici copulationes et complexiones et adhaesiones

to the abstruse subject of moral liberty, in the pas—
