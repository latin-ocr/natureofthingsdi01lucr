THE NATURE ΟΕ 'Mimos

With joys beyond e'en Nature’s utmost wish.

What, though the dome be wanting, whose proud walls

bability, taken immediately from Homer-’s picture of
the palace of Alcinous, beginning

Χρυσειοι δ’ apa. κουροι, tugiam& επι &xlm-v, &c.

Od. H. v. 100.

The sront appear'd, with radiant splendors gay,
Bright as the lamp of night, or orb of day.
The walls were massy brass: the cornice high
Blue metals crown’d in colours of the sky 3—
Refulgent pedestals the walls surmund,
Which boys ofgold‚ with flaming torches, crown'd.
The polish'd ore, reflecting every ray,
Blaz’d on the banquets with a double day.

Pore.

Yet the philosophie moral, in which consists the
chief beauty of the description, is altogether our
poet’s own: and Virgil has not been inattentive to
so rich a treasure. ln the second book of his Geor-
gics, he has therefore introduced a passage, obviously
referring to this of Lucretius, and extending to a
length too considerable for insertion in this note. It
begins at ver. 461.

Si non ingentem foribus domus alta superbis

Mane salutantum totis vomit aedibus undam—

At secura quies, et nescia fallere vita,

Dives opum variarum ς at latis otia fundis,

Speluncae, vivique lacus ; at frigida Tempe, διε.

Thomson is under an equal and similar obligation
to our poet: though the parallel passage in Thom-
son is rather a more exact transcript of Virgil than of
Lucretius. I refer to his description of the happiness

ofa rural life in his Autumn‚ in which we find the
following lines ι

What, tho’ the dorne be wanting, whose proud gate

Each morning vomits out the sneaking crowd
Of courtiers false, and iu their turn abus’d ἓ

Vile intercourse ! What, tho’ ,the glitt'ring robe

Of every hue reflected light can give—

The pride and gaze of fools oppress him not 3—
- Sure peace is his : a solid life estrang'd

To disappointment, and fallacious hope——

These are not wanting—nor the chide ‘ff streams

And hum of bees, inviting sleep sincere
Into the guiltless breast‚ benealh the „el-adr, &a
ver. 1:07.

ΜΓ, Roscoe‚ in his life of Lei-enzo de Med-101.
has favour-ed us with some verses of this highly-gifted
sage, which are obviously drawn from the same exu-
berant fountain, and are at least equal to any os
those I have already quoted.

Cerchi chi vuol, le pompi e gli alte honori
Le piane, e tempii, e gli edificii magni,
Le delicie, il tesor, qual accompagni
Mille duri pensier, mille dolori:

Un verde praticel pien di bei fiori,

Un rivolo, che l'herba intorno bagni,

Un augelletto, che d’amor si lagni,

Acquetta molto meglio i nostro ardori :
L'ombrose selve, i sassi, e gli alti monti,

Gli antri oscuri e le fere fugitivi,

Seek he who will in grandem· to be blest,
Place in proud halls, and splendid courts hisjoy ;
For pleasure or for gold his arts employ‚
Whilst all his hours unnumber’d cares molest.
A little field in native flow'rets drest,
A riv’let in soft murmurs gliding by,
A bird, whose love-sick note salutes the sky,
With sweeter magic lull my cares to rest.

And shadowy woods‚ and rocks, and tow'ring hills.
And caves obscure, and nature’s free-born train
