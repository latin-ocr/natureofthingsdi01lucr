propriated to those in common use a sense foreign to that in which
they are daily employed upon other, or even similar occasions3 so
that the proselyto has not only the task of learning a new language
before he can be initiated into the Kantian philosophy, but of un-
loarning that which it has cost him years, perham, to acquire· It is
on this account that M. Kieseweter, as well as several other disciples'
of the professor, hare attempted to re-model its nomenclature, to ren-
der 'nis conceptions less obscure and recondite, and to present the whole
theory⁷ in a form more abridged and systematic ἧς. At the present mo-
ment, nothing in Germany is so fashionable as the study of the Trans-
cendental Philosophy, or Criticism of pure Reasom as its inventor has cho-
sen to denominate it3 but. many, who have studied it, are dissatisfied
with it already, and appear to be aiming at an erection of different
schools out of its ruins, Its chief antagonists for this purpose are
M. M. Jacobi and Reinhold, and an anonymous author, who signs
himself OEnesidemus, all of whom seem equally sensible ofits insuffi-
ciency, and have hence attempted to connect it with some other
theory. Jacobi, like Leibnitz, whose system in many respects he
avowedly prefers to the Kantian, is a professed Platonist, and on this

account is for connecting the Transcendental Philosophy with Plato-
nism ·†· : OEnesidemuS, as his fictitions name importS, is a Sceptic, and

he, on the contrary, is for conciliating it with the philosophy of
Pyrrho ξι while Reinhoffl, who has invented a sort of theory of his
own, which is (lenominated Elementary Philosophy, makes it his ob-
ject to form a junction between the Transcendental and the Elemen-
tary ᾗ. After all, however, Kantism itself‚ notwithstanding its proud
boast of perfect independence and originality, seems, in many
respectS, to be little more than a kind of modern eclectism, an hy-
pothesis decluced from prior schools, and in many instances betraying
