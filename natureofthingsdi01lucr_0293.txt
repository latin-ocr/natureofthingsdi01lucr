THE NATURE OF THINGS.

145

Must, too, develope‚ in its secret womb,

Plants, fruits, and foliage, oft dispers’d, and hid:

And, to the woodman, the cleft stock disclose

With ashes smoke, and smoke commixt with fire.

These, facts deny: in things things ne’er exist;

955

But seeds of thingS, in various modes arrang'd,

Various themselves : whence rises all survey'd.

But should'st thou urge that oft beneath the storm,

When rubb’d by many a repercussion rude,

Branch against branch, the forest’s topmost height

960

Has blaz'd from tree to tree3 the fact we grant:

Not, with each trunk, that native fires combine ς

But that perpetual friction quick collects

Their seeds dispers'd; hence gathering ten—fold force,

ground, and reduced to the state of charcoal, but
also trees standing upright, which, though they had
escaped destruction, had yet been miserably scorched:
others black, and bending down to one side, whilst‚
in the midst of the ruins of trunk and branehes, ap-
peared a group of young trees rising to replace the
former generation ; and, full of vig-our and vegetable
life, seemed to be deriving their nourishment from
the ashes of their parents.'' Acerbi's Travels, Ι. Ρ,
2²9· 231.

Has blaz’d ] The description of the forest
ι in flames, in the AEneid, is not widely different from
the present, in several of its bearings.

 

Ac velut optato, ventis aestate coortis,
Dispersa immittit sylvis incendia pastor ι
Vor.. 1.

Correptis subito mediis, extenditur una
Horrida per latos acies Vulcania campos :
Ille sedens victor flammas despectat ovantes.
L. x. 40 ς.
As when, in summer, welcome winds arise,
The watchful shepherd to the forest flies,
And {ires the midmost shrubs3 contagion spreads,
And rushing flames infest the neighb'ring heads :
Around the forest flies the burning blast‚
And all the leafy nation sinks at last,
And Vulcan rides in triumph o'er the waste.
The pastor, pleas’d with his dire victory,

Beholds the satiate flames in sheets ascend the sky.
