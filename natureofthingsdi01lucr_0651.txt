THE NATURE OF THINGS.

501

‘⁶ The dulcet kiss that rous’d thy secret soul,

‘⁶ Again shall never hasten !——nor thine arm,

“ With deed heroic, guard thy country’s weal !—

“ O mournful, mournful fate!

‘⁶ One envious hour of these invalued joys

'⁹ thy friends exclaim,

930

“ Robs thee for ever !'’——But they add not here,

“ It robs thee, too, of all desire of joy :''

A truth, once utter’d, that the mind would free

An dem halse der mutter mit vaterfreudun zu

griissen ;

Da erschlug ihn ein laurenderfeind, ein morderi im

dunkeln! Mamm, Ges. v.

Come, let me see the man that yonder lies

Dying, and wrung with anguish as he dies 3

And mark his gory woundS. In dead of night

Haply he hasted, with a sire's delight‚

To clasp his babes, that round their mother's knee,

Lisp’d his dear name. These never shall he see !

By ruthless ruffinus murder'd !—

Equally in point, with both these cstations, is the
following, by Collins ; affording a picture which
yields to neither of them in tenderness or beauty. It
comprises a part of his well-known description of the

Kelpie‚ οι· water-flend ε
For him, in vain, his anxious wife shall wait,
Or wanden· forth to meet him on his way ;
For him, in vain, at to-fall of the day,
His babes shall linger at [h' unclosing gate.——
Ah ! ne'er shall he return !—

I add the following from Dyen because, though
it offers a parallel, if not a copied image, it directs it
to a happier purpose. The poet is representing the
agricultural providence of a worthy cottager with
whom he was acquainted, and !who never suffered
the growth of useless trees about the few acres he
occupied ι

Only a slender tuft of useful ash,

And mingled beech‚ and clm, securely tall,

The little smiling cottage warm embower’d ε

The little smiling cottage, where at eve

He meets his rosy children at the door,

Prattling their welcomes, and his honest wife,

With good brown cake, and bacon elice, intent ‚

To cheer his hunger after labour hard.
Ἑιεεςε, Book I.

Of a purport precisely similar, and pregnant
with similar imagery, is the ensuing address of a
cottager to his belovcd wife, from the Idyls of
Gessner, with which Ishall conclude this note.
It occurs in his Herbstmorgen: Bey dir ein-
geschlossen mogen winde wiiten, und schneeges-
tober- die ganze aussicht rauben3 dann erst siihl
iehs, wie du mir alles Bist. Die fiille meines gliickes
seydihr, ihr anmuthsvolle kinder‚ mit jedem liebreitz
der mutter geschmiickt 3 was fiir segen blh'ht in euch
uns anf. Die *erste silbe die sie euch stammeln lehrte,
wars, mir zu sagen, dass ihr mich liebet. lVenn
ihr, komm ich vom felde oder von der heerde zuriick,
an der schwelle mit frohem gewimmel mich ruffet3
aa melnen knien hangend, mit kindischer frende
die kleinen geschenke empfanget; O wie etquicht
mich dann jede curer unschuldvollen freuden!

“ then seat<d by thee, let the pent—up winds put
forth their rage3 let the §now-§torm cover the face

of the earth ; then chiefly feel I that thou art every
thing to me. May the fulncss of my prosperity be
the lot of yourselvce, ye lox-ely childrm! adormd
with every grace of your mother, which blossoms as
a blessing upon us both! The first syllable. she
