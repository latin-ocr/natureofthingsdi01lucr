Boon I. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 3527

From other substance, must perforce decay‚
So all to nought would perish, and again
From nought regerminate to growth mature:
Doctrines the muse already has disprov’d,
Such seeds, too, must be soes ; created each ¹ 820
Tc each adverse ; and hence can never meet
But sure perdition waits: or, chance, they part,
Disperst :abrupt‚ 33, in contending storius,
wind, rain, and thunder scatter‚ and are lost.
But, from such four—sold foes, could all things spring, 825
And, sprung, to such dissolve—why rather term
Those jarring powers the primal seeds of things
Than things of thern? since, in alternate course,
Each fiows from each: th’ alternate form is seiz'd‚

Th’ alternate nature, through perennial time. 830

Yet could’st thou dcem such powers adverse might blend,
And earth with fire, with ether lymph commix,

And still retain their natures unimpair’d3

Whilst thus retained, no living form could rise

Τ rac’d through creation‚ animate, or void, 83 5
As springs the verdant shrub, of reasoning soul.

For each its nature, through the varying mass,

Would still evince, and earth with air commix,

Organic forms with chemic changes sti-ive, Irnmortal matter braves the transient storm,
vae but to die, and die but to revive ; Mounts in the wreck, unchanging but in form.
