Ver. 650.
Should traco-und Ru AEA shed εἰει-παῖ tears.] Of
Rhaea‚see the preceding note. Satum is represented by
different traditions to have been the husband, the son,
and brother of Rhaea. He was once imprisoned by his
brother Titan, iu consequence of a dispute between
them, and liberated from his confinement by his sonJu-
piter. Still apprehending, however, in consequence of
the declaration ofthe oracle upon this subject, that Ju-
piter would seize from him his crown, and subvert his
governmeut, he continued to devise a variety of plote
to destroy him; and hence it occurred, that Jupiter
was at length compelled to depose him; and actually
banished him from the island of Crete, over which he
had reigned. Saturn fied, with all speed, from the fury
of his son, who still pursued him, and secreted him-
self, according to Virgil‚ in the country which, on
this account, was afterwards denominated Latium,
or the hiding—place. Here he collected, from all
quai-teis. a large body of subjects‚ and appears to have
learnt wisdom from his adversity ; for he drew up
a most excellent code of laws, governed with
impartial justice, and even paternal affection, aud

is thus said to have introduced among mortals the

Composuit, legesque dedit ; Latiumque vocari
Maluit, his quoniam latuisset tutus in oris.

Saecula : si: placida populos in pace regebat ;
AEusm. viii. 321.
The men, disper-st on hius, to towns he brought ς

And Latium eall’d the land where sqfe he lay
From his unduteous son, and his usurping sway.
With his mild empire peace and plenty came,
And hence the golden times den‘v'd their name.

Vossius, in consequence of Saturn’s being reported,
by another tradition, to have been the son of Coelum
and Terra (heaven and earth), believes him to be sy-
nonimous with Adam: he endeavours to trace his
name from the Hebrew verb sotar, to lie hid,· and
imagines that, in this etymology, he finds an equal
reference to the ssight and migration of Saturn to the
