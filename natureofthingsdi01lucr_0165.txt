almighty MARS, 35

Struck by triumphant Love's eternal wound‚

Reclines full frequent : with uplifted gaze

On thee he feeds his longfflg,

“ he beheld her, of the amorous poison which he
“ drank in with his eyes.’'

Among the Asiatics this imagery is extremely
common; and many of their most favourite meta-
phors are hence derived. Thus Ferdusi, in his Shah
Nameh ε

ΨΜ §5244 ἐφ’ ᾸῙ ff. ΗΛ)
Lips sweet as wine, and fragrant as the rose.

So Hafiz‚ the pride of the bowcrs of Shiraz, with
more amplification still :

Q'swf 22³⁹· ἐϋ
rou zor, 02³5&- est> ἧς)

Drink then kisses sweet as wine

From thy favourite damsel’s cheek 3
Never shall her like be thine,

Though through paradise thou scek.

In my notes on the Song of Songs, Ι have given
many other instances of the same figure. Solomon
himself was indeed equally attached to it. Thus in the
opening apostrophe of the royal bride, Chap. i. 1.

Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth ;
For thy love is delicious above wine.

And again, in the following passage, in which the
simile equally refers to both eating and drinking;
the royal lover, having previously compared his fair
bride to a garden or paradise of sweets, on which he
was panting to banquet, Chap. ii. 8.

Eat, O my friend! drink,
Yea, drink abundantly, O my beloved!

Perhaps the most exquisite simile of this kind that
occurs in modern poetry is to be found in the elegant
and well-known song of Β. Jonson, generally sung as
a glee. It is a direct imitation indeed frcm the Greek
of Philostratus, but the copy is superior to its ori-
ginal ; and there is a degree of moral truth and sub-
limity in the two first lines of the followingvstanzm

which elevates them above all praise-
Vox.. I.

ling’ring eyeS, ,

The thir-st that in the soul doth riso
Doth ask a drink divine ,-

Drink to me only with thine eyes,
And Ι will pledge with mine.

In the following, Mr. Sotheby proves that he is by
no means an unapt scholar in the imitative artS. It
occurs in his spirited and harmonicus version of Wie-
land¹s Oberon ς but its merit is certainly, for the
most part, his own ς the idea conveyed in the original
not exactly corresponding to the imagery exhibited
in the translation. The passage is a part of the sixth
canto of this fanciful and highly fiuished poem, and
occupies the 54th stanza of the German.

Sic ist nun ganz fiir Hiion neugeborem
Gab alles, was sie wan, fiir ihn, διε.

Amantia, too, o’erpower’d with fond desires,
To long-lost joys restor'd, thus warmly press'd.
Resigns herself, caressing and carest‚

To each warm kiss that wak'ning passion fires.
His mouth the never-sated draught renews,

And from herlip, in sweet voluptuous dews,
Drinks deep oblivion of foreboded woes-

Such are the beauties to which the imagery‚ and,
in some instances‚ the immediate passage before us,
has given birth. The following, however, is an ex-
ample of false taste‚ and a case in which it ought not
to have been copied. It occurs in the Syphilis of
Fracastorio‚ a poem which is nevertheless possessed of
much general merit.

Ulcera (prole divum pietatem !) informia pulchro·
Pascebant oculos, et diae lucis amorem,

L. i.
Foul uleers fed (kind heav’ns l) the beaute-eus eye,

The day’s sweet lusti-e ; fed, with acrid grume,
Th’ eroded nostrils.

Pascebantque acri corrosas vulnere nares.

This passage requires no comment. The absurdity
of applying a metaphor, that should be sacred to de-
licate and agreeable subjects alone, to so foul and
fetid an exhibiti0n‚ must be obvious to every one„
