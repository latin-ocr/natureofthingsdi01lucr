Gambol their wanton young, each little heart

THE NATURE OF THINGS.

Quivering beneath the genuine nectar quaff’ d.

So nought can perish, that the sight surveys,
With utter death3 but Nature still renews

Each from the other, nor can form afresh

One substance, till ¹another be destroy⁷d.

305

But come, my friend, and, since the muse has sung

Things cannot spring from, or return to nought,

Lest thou should'st urge, still sceptic, that no eye

Their generative atoms e’er has trac’d3

Mark in what scenes thyself must own, perforce,

From flocks shrill bleating.. In yon mead the steer
Bends his huge bulk by rivulets cool and clear ;
While bold, impetuous‚ fieree, and fill’d with pride
The warrior beast‚ that issu'd from the tide,
Displays, as o’er the fattening glebe he ss<ims

His dauntless force, and savage grace of limbs.

 

Ver. 302. Nature all renews

Each from the other, &c.—] The discoveries
of modern chemistry have established the truth of this
doctrine beyond the possibility of controversy. Every
thing is produced from, and nourished by, every
thing ; by the recombination of the particles of one
body, when decompounded, a second body is gene-
rated, from this second a third, from this third a
fourth, and in the same manner to infinity. “The
corruption of one substance,” observed Aristode,
many ages ago, “is the generation of another: and
‘⁸ the generation of one substance is the corruption
‘⁸ of another.'' It would form an admirable motto
to the Lavoisierian system. ‘H τουδε φθοςοι, αλλου γι-

rso-13 ἦ τουδε ’γενεῦ-ις αλλου φθοςα..

There is hence much appropriate beauty in that
part of the heathen mythology which represents Sa-

310

turn, or Chronus, the origin of all things, the father
of gods and men, as devouring the children he had
generated; and hence, too, the strict propriety‚ as
well as elegance, of the following line addressed to
him in one of the hymns of Orpheus:

‘05 δαπανοις μεν ewra-aroc και αυξεις εμπαλιν ava-of.

Thou all-consuming, all-renewing power!

Ver. 306. But come, myfriend, &c.-] The poet is
not content with having logically established the truth
of his position; he is anxious to remove every doubt
which can possibly be urged in opposition to it. And
the only argument which he conceives capable of
producing doubt at all is, that no such eternal and
unchangeable principles or seeds are discoverable in
bodies by ocular perception. The force of such ar-
gument or observation, however, he completely frus-
trates by proving, in a variety of elegant and appo-
site instances, that we unanimously admit the exist-
ence of bodies even where, as in the case in question,
the eye is possest of no power of decision; and a
different tribunal is appealed to. The illustration ef
this assertion is continued to verse 373.-
