BOOK 1, THE NATURE OF THINGS. 95

Whose power alone can such enclosures form. 570
But solids must be matter3 the prime seeds '
Of all survey’d, harmonious in their act„

And undecay’d when all decays around.

VVere there no space, th’ ENTIRE or THrNGs would prove
One boundless solid ε and were nought conceiv’d 575
Of viewless seeds, close filling, void of space,

Each spot possest, all then were vacuum blank.

Thus each from each, from matter space exists

Distinet and clear: since never all is void,

Nor ever full ; but this from that preserv’d 580
By countless atoms acting though unseen.

These, as already sung, no powers can pierce t·

O’er blows external, 9'er each vain attempt

Of penetrative· solvents, or aught else

Philosophy reveals, triumphant still. 58 5-
For nought can break, of vacuum all devoid‚

Or melt, or moulder, or. within admit

Vapour, or cold, or power of pungent heat,

By which dissolves this fabric of the world.

’Tis vacuum lays the base: as this exists, 59o
AugmentS, or lessenS, things alone decay.. .
What then is solid, and from vacuum free,

Must undecay’d, and still eternal live..
