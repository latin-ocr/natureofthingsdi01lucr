DE* RERUM NATURA.

Lm. Ι.

Praeterea, qua re quisquam magis omnia tollat,

Et velit ardoris naturam linquere solam,

Quam neget esse igneiS, summam tamen esse relinquat?

AEqua videtur enim dementia dicere utrumque.

705

Quapropter, quei materiem rerum esse putarunt

Ignem, atque ex igni summam consistere posse ;

Et quei principium gignundis a‘e'ra rebus

Constituere ς aut humorem queiquomque putarunt

Ver. 765. —thosesor Ain who strive] The same
arguments urged against fire, as the principle of all
things, will apply with equal force against every
other simple and individual substance whatever. For
one unigenous substance can produce but one uni-
genous substance, and not a diversity. Anaxi-
menes, however, a philosopher contemporary with
Alexander the Great, and who on his decease wrote
his history, a work that has been long lost to the
world, conceived differently. And since Heraclitus
had entered the lists as champion for fire, Anaximenes
threw down the gauntletin favour of Ain ; assertiug,
after the reasoning of the former philosopher, that
all things were generated by a successive condensa·
tion and rarefaction of this clement: and that the
world was animated and held together by its opera-
tion, in the same manner as the body is animated and
held together by the soul; which last substance he
likewise conceived to be of ae'rial origin. Air, too,
or ether, upon the same principle as fire, has had its
mythologie as well as its philosophie supporters,
with respect to its being the common origin of au
things. Hence, Jupiter himself is generally repre-
sented by the poets under the symbol of this ele-
mcnt: and the following language, figuratively em-
ployed by Lucretius on another occasion, is by them
adopted in its literni senset

All springs from heaven etherial, all that lives.
The sire of all is ether.

B. ii. xooo. Nn. 01³ Tames-
Hence Coelum or Ουρανος, in the chronology of

Hesiod, is in like manner represented as the common
father of all things, impregnating the earth by his
embraces. Our author reverts to this opinion, and
again opposes it in b. ii. 1167 ς to the note on which
I refer the reader.

An, according to the belief of Boerhaave, is not
the origin of all things ; but that in which all things
are contained. It is the universal chaos or colluvies
of created matters. Whatever fire can volatilize, the
magnetic and electric fluid, and that which is ejected
from the heavenly bodies, all, in his conception,
combine in the composition of air.

In the Memoirs of the French Royal Academy,
1703, is a paper of M. Amontons, in which, after
observing that air may be compressed so as to be ren-
dered heavier than gold, platina, or any other sub-
stance we are acquainted with: after conjecturing,
mox-cover, that the body of the earth is composed of
strata of substances of different gravities, progres-
sively taking their stations according to their grada-
tion of weight, he asserts, that the centre of the
earth, containing a sphere of 6451,538 fathoms dia-
meter, is composed of air, thus compressed to a den-
sity greater than that of any known substance besides :
and srom such elastic air, expanded by the heat of
subterraneous fires, he deduces all the earthquakes
that have ever agitated the globe.

Although it does not appear, then, that all things,
in the opinion of M. Amontons, originated from air,
yet by far the greater part is air, and nothing
else.
