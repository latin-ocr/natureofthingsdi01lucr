book, therefore, closed the labours of Evelyn ; and no one who is ac-
quaintcd with his version, will regret that it did not extend farther.

About twenty years posterior to this unsatisfactory effort, Creech
introduced, before the public, his translation of the entire poem; and
shortly afterwards published‚ at the Oxford press, a new and valuable
