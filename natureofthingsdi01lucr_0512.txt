DE RERUM NATURA*

Lm. 11.

Praeteritis, laudat fortunas saepe parentis.

Tristis item Vetulae vitis sator, [acta peragrans]

Temporis, incusat numen, coelumque fatigat3

Et crepat, antiquum genus ut, pietate repletum,

Perfacile angustis tolerarit finibus aevom,

if Origen opposed it successfully in his own era, our
own countryman, Whist0n‚ inculcated it so strenu-
ously in his day, that even in the present, there are
no small numbers of Christians who admit the doc-
trine into their creed. And for this, they have, at

in which, philanthropy is to be developed in all its
generous and extensive operations, and in which its
fairest projects are to be realized. This millennium
is daily approximating, and its arrival is accelerated

by moml and intellectual discussions.’' See, on this
subject, a small essay of the Professor-⁹8, imported by
De Boffe, 1798, and entitled, Idee de qui poninit
&tre une Histoire universelle dans les Mains d’un
Cosmopolit.
