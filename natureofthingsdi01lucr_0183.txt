THE NATURE OF THINGS.

35

Yet doubtful is the doctrine, and unknown

Whether, co-eval with th’ exter-nal frame,

The soul first lives, when lives the body first,

125

Or boasts a date anterior: whether doom'd

s To common ruin, and one common grave,

Or through the gloomy shadeS, the lakes, the caves,

⁵ Of EREBUS to wander: or, perchance,

As ENNIUS taught, immortal bard, whose brows

130

Unfading laurels bound, and still whose verse

All Rome recites, entranc'd———perchance condemn'd

<Ter- 126. Or boasts a date anterior :—] Plato, in
various parts of his Dialogues, seems to have imagined
that the soul exists from all eternity, and continues
waiting in some distant star till the moment of the
formation of its appropriate body, with which it then
immediately unites itself, and continues in a state of
intimate connection, till, at length, it is once more
separated by death; when, according to its degree
of moral merit, it is sentenced to Erebus or Elysium.
Pythagoras believed, with Plato, that souls were of
eternal existence, and, of course, incorporea13 but
that upon the dissolution of one body, in which they
were placed, they constantly transmigrated to another,
as well to the body of brutes as of men. This doc-
trine ofthe metempsychosis,or transmigration of souls,
is of immemorial date, and was equally believed by
the Hindus and the Egyptians; from the last of
whom Pythagoras probably received it, during his
travels into Asia. It was not, however, confined
either to Egypt, Hindustan, or Greece ; for we find
it equally credited‚ at an early age, in China, and
among the Celts in general 3 and particularly among
those of Britain and Gaul. It is hence supposed,
by Mr. Davies, to have constituted a common topic
of belief among mankind, 'even in the first post-dilu-
viczn century ; for to an epoch thus early does he re-

fer the Celtic and Druidic colonizations of Spain and
Britain. These, however, are learned and ingenious
conceptions, rather than facts of solid and applicable
proof. The reader may amuse himself with such,
and various other opinions, in this elaborate wn'ter's
volume of ‘⁴ Celtic Researches.'' It appears, from
verse 133, that Ennius himself had, at‘some period
of his life, inclined to a belief in the metempsychosis ς

though, at another period, he seems to have changed
his opinion.

Ver. 126. whether doom'd
To common ruin, and one commen grave, &c.]
Thus Mr. Cowper, in his beautiful and descriptive
poem, “ The Task.”

 

Has man within him an immortal soul?
Or does the tomb take all ? If he survive
His ashes—where ἓ and in what weal or woe?
B. ii.
Ver. 130. As Esums laught, immortal bard,—]
Ennius, the Spencer of the Roman poetS, flourished
about a century before Lucretius, and was the first
who attempted an heroic poem in his native language.
lt is much to be lamented that we have nothing of
his writing transmitted to us, in modern times, but
