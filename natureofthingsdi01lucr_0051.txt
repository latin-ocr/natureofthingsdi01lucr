THE LIFE OF LUCRETIES. xxxvii

In the reth-cd and unmolcstcd shadcs ho had chmen, happy in lii5
domestic 00011οΧ1005, occupied by the studies of philosophy, success-
sully cultivating the muses, and occasionally enlircneil by the rosort
of his carly and inore ambitious friends, our poet proved how well lw
was entitleil 10 tho ειη-1101110 of 0111108, 01· tho Ammonis, and coin-
poscd his unrivallcd poem on tho Nix'runn 01³ 'l'iirNGsz a poem
which was read with cnthusiasm by tho most lom-nod of his own, as
well as of the Augustali age· that immediately succceded, and which
will perpetuate his name as long as language 011111)Ἰν kind shall live to

pronouncc it.

The composition of this excellent work seems to have afforded him
an uninterrupted source of pleasure; sor there is scarcely a book
which does not contain many passages testimonial of thc delight il
produced. Of future samo he was not unambitious‚—but it was not
the fame of the warrior, whose laurels are criinsoned with blood, 01· of
the rapacious praetor, whose palace was too generally erected, and
beautified with the spoils of the province hc was appointed to defend.
It was the pure and unsullied fame of the poet ancl the philosopher:
of the sage, who glows with satisfaction at the thought of having la—
boured night and (lay for the benefit of his race; of thc patri0t‚ who
weeps over the vices of his country, while he is anxious to instruct
the public mind, and correct the public morals. Conscious of being
actuated by these honourable motives, he more than oncc bursts soi-tl»

into the' following exclamation :

the thirst of fame
Burns all my bosom, and through ev’ry nerve
Darts the proud love of letters and the muse.

1 feel th’ inspiring pow'r, and roam resolv'd
Through paths P1ER1AN never trod before.
Sweet are the springing founts with nectar new,
