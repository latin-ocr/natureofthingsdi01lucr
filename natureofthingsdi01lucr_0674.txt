DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm, ΙΙΙ,

Hinc Acherusia fit stultorum denique vita.

Hocc' etiam tibi tute interdum dicere possis ε

“ Lumina sis oculis etiam bonus Ancus reliquit 3⁹⁹

Qui melior multis, quam tu, fuit, inprobe! rebus.

our— poet has painted with a masterly hand, in ver.
937, he now contrasts with the tumultuous and af-
frighted life, the horrid and fem-ful decease of the

wicked. Dr. Glynn, to whose poem on the Day of

J'udgment 1 have referred once oi> twice before, as
comprising passages that have a strong analogy to
the style of Lucretius, and have much intrinsic evi-
dence οῗ being hence deduced, has also conveyed this
contrasted idea in very appropriate language, in the
following lines z

horror gnaws the guilty soul
Of dying sinners, while the good man sleeps
Peaceful and calm, and with a smile expires.

 

Ver. 1058· Hence earth igſsff to fools becomrs a
helk] Thus Gesner, in the soliloquy of
Cain, after awaking from his dream: zieht en den
vorhang weg, und lass mich in die holle dei· zukunft
hinaus-sehn. ‘⁴ He drawa aside the veil, and unfolds
to me the hell of posterity.’' Death of Abel, Book
IV. The Germans are particularly attached to this
bold imagery z but there is a striking and tremendous
passage in the Robbers of Schiller‚ so illustrative of
this, and the three or four preceding verses, that I
cannot avoid adding it. It is a sudden exclamation
of Moor‚ the hero of the drama, in a dialogue be-
tween himself and Rasman: “ My innocence! O
my innoeencesia-See how all Nature expands at ’,ὡς
sweet breath of spring—O God ! that this paradiu—
this heaven——should be a HELL to mel—When all is
happiness—all in the sweet spirit os peace—the world
one family——and its father there above, who is not
my fatherff-Ialone the outcast—-the prodigal son 1-
Of all the. children ,of his mercy‚ I alone rejected !
the companion of murderers—of viperous fiends—
bound down, enchained to guilt and horror.’'—So
the sublime epie poet of our own nation z

which way shall 1 fly

 

Infinite wath, and infinite despair ?
Which way Ifly is hell—myseff am hell.
PAR. Losr, iv. 75,

Not less terribly descriptive‚ and equally bold in
expression, is the following passage from the book of
Job, ch. xviii. 5—17 ι in the version of which 1 have
endeavoured to preserve the different per-sonifications
of the original z

5 Fail shall the light that guides the sinner's way3
The vital flame that cheers him shall decay:

And haunt hia steps, where'er those steps may
