The jocund clover calls them,

THE NATURE OF THINGS.

and the lambs

That round them gambol, saturate with milk,

Proving their frontlets in the mimic fray—

Press, at this distance, on the sight confus’d,

One white mass forming o’er the verdant steep.

Thus, too, when warlike squadrons crowd the field,

Horrent in arms, with horses scarce restrain'd,

The idea of thus cloatbing, oi· cover-ing the vei-dant
glebe with the reflected whiteness of the flocks that
feed on it, is highly beautiful and pieturesque.. So
Psalm lxv. 13.

The pastures are cloathed with flocks.

Ver. 331. Thus, too, when warlike squadrons crowd

The whole passage is manifestly deduced from the
Iliad of Homer, though, in some degree, enlarged
and improved ε ’
Atym δ’ ουρανον ms· ’γελασσε δε ποια-οι περι χθων

Broad glittering breast—plateffi spears with pointed
rays
Mix in one stream, reflecting blaze on blaze ;
Thick beats the centre as the coursers bound,
With splendour flame the skies, and laugh the
fields around. Por> Ε.

Ιη Hesiod's Shield quercules, we, in like manner,
meetwith the following animated and parallel passage:

Ευρε γαρ εν *referrri εκσιτηξολου Amnum,-

Αυτον, και παπ-φ’ vv, Apnv, αυτον πολεμοιο,
Τευχεσι λαμπομενους, σελας ως πυρος afflabat-uoco,
Emaw’ εν διφρω· >cuffiam δ’ εκτυπον ωκεες lam-02,

Κοπτομεκη, mama-osmi ὑφ’ affluo-⁴, και ’,τοο-ιν ἵππων,

N υσσοντες χηλησι· κο

Him in Apollo’s sacred grove he found,
Him, and his sire, the god who thir-sts for war:

Glitt'ring in arms, the martial car they fill’d

With blaze of brightest flame. Their rapid steecls

Beat the firm ground, reverberating loud:

While clouds of dust play round them, upwards
urg’d

By the fleet coursers and the whirling wheels.

Towards the latter part of this description of Lu-
cretius, it is probable virgil had his eye directed,
when, describing the battle between the Trojans and
the Latins, he wrote

 

tum caeco pulvere campus
Miscetur, pulsuque pedum tremit excita tellus.
AEm-:m xii. v. 444.

Dust blinds the battle-field, and the vext earth ⁷
Shakes with the tread of hoofs, rebounding
wide.

This is the more likely, because there can be no
doubt, that he has borrowed the imagery of the
earlier part of the picture before us, on another occa-
sion3 though I see no notice taken of the copy, in
any of the commentaries upon either poet. In Lu-
cretius it occurs thus, ver. 323.

Praeterea, magnae legiones quom loca cursu
Camporum conplent, belli simulacra cientes ;
Fulgur ubi ad coelum se tollit, totaque circum
AEre renidescit tellus, &c-

Virgil expresses himself in this manner:

Ut saepe ingenti belli quom longa cohortes
Explicuit legio, et campo stetit agmen aperto,
Directaeque acies, ac late fluctuat omnis

AEre renidenti tellus, &c-
