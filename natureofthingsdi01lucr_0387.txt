Boon ΙΙ. THE NATURE OE THINGS. 239

, Light, the clear glass pervades, while lymph recoils :⁸
Whence springs the diff 'rence‚ but that subtler seeds
Rear the bright sun-bearn than the fountain form ? 39 5
Free through the strainer Hows the sparkling wine,
While the slow oil hangs heavy: in its course
*Check’cL or by atoms of a grosser fmme,
Or more perplex’d, and tangled3 each from each .
Hence severing tardy‚ and, with toil extreme, 400

Transuding sep'rate through th' attenuate lawn.

Α ¹ Thus vary tastes: and while the dulcet draught
Of milk, *or honey charms th’ enchanted lip,
The wormwood strait convulses, by the tongue
Abhorr’d, and writhing every sapid nerve. 405
Hence mily’st thou leam those seeds that rouse, combin’d,
Ajoyous flavour, round exist, and smooth 3
While those that form the bitter, and austere,
Are hook'd, or jagged, and their path propel
Alone by wounding, hostile to the sense. 410

Thus all things live3 from primal atoms rear’d

Of shape diverse, as deep within they ope

Tristia tentantum sensu torquebit nutaret. Distorted turn, and hate the bitter sip.
