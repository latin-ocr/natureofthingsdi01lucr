DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. III.

Proinde, ubi se videas hominem indignarier ipsum,

Post mortem fore, ut aut putescat corpore posto,

Aut flammis interfiat, malisve ferarum3

885

Scire licet, non sincerum sonere, atque subesse

Caecum aliquem cordi stimulum3 quam vis neget ipse

Credere se quemquam sibi sensum in morte futurum.

Non, ut opinor, enim dat, quod promittit et unde,

Nec radicitus e vita se tollit, et eicit ;

890

Sed facit esse sui quiddam super inscius ipse.

Unus enim sibi quom proponit quisque, futurum

Corpus utei volucres lacerent in morte, feraeque3

Ipse sui miseret: neque enim se dividit hilum,

Ver. 893. Slvonld'st thou, then, mark somefool‚ in-
dignant, burn] The common editions of
the original uniformly offer the following verse:

Proinde, ubi se uideas hominem miset-arier ipsum,

which Mr. Wakefield, with commendable sagacsty,

hus thus corrected from better authorities ι
Proinde, ubi se videas hominem indignarier ipsum.

Democritus, though he denied the existence of an
immaterial soul, >et as a great part of the human sys-

following lines of Ovid, spoken in the character of
Pythagoras himself, to have been as frequently sub-

ject to the same cowardly apprehensione. as the dis-
ciples of Democritus:

O genus attonitum gelidae formidine mortis.

Qrid Styga, qnid tenebras, quid nomina vana ti-
metis,

Materiem vatum, falsique piacula mundi ?

Corpora sive rogus flamma, seu tabe vetustas

Abstulerit, mala posse pati non uua putetis.

Morte carent animae ς semperque, priore relicta

Sede, novis domibus habitant, vivuntque receptae.
L. xv. 1 5 3.

O race, that start at Death’s funereal gloom!

Why fear ye Styx, or stoi-ies of the tomb?

The vain conceits by priests, and poets told,

Lies that the world in pious bondage hold ἓ

No pain ye feel, dissever how ye may,

By blazing pyres, or Time’s remote decay.

Souls never die 3 one mansion lest behind,

They seek another, and another find.

It is astonishing to remark the dread that pre-
vailed amongst the multitude of former times, and
even as just noticed, the followers of many ancient
philosophers‚ lest the corpse itself should continue to
suffer during its consumption. Our poet expressly
adverts to the alarm so generally excited by the mere
idea of being devoured, after death, by a beast or
