Taugimus, haud ullo sentimus tincta colore.

Quod, quoniam vinco fieri, nunc esse docebo.

Omnis enim color omnino mutatur in omneis ;

Quod facere haud ullo debent primordia pacto ε

Imnutabile enim quiddam superare neccsse est,

750(

Ne res ad nihilum redigantur funditus omnes.

Nam, quodquomque suis mutatum finibus exit,

Continuo hoc mors cst illius, quod fuit ante.

Proinde, colore cave continguas semina reruni,

alterations are made in the porphyry by the presence
or absence of light; and that those ideas of white-
ness and redness are really in porphyry in the light,
when it is plain it has no colour in the dark Ρ It has,
indeed, such a corfiguration of particles, both night
and day, as are apt, by the rays of light rebounding
from some parts of that hard stone, to produce in us
the idea of redness, and from others, the idea of
whiteness. But whiteness or redness are not init
at any time, but such a texture that hath the power
to produce such a sensation in us.'' Locke on Hum.
Unders. Book II. c. viii. Lucretius could not have
expressed the doctrine he meaned to inculcate more
pertinently3 the instance of not perceiving coloured
bodies in the dark is, perhaps, taken from him·
self3 as most assuredly, is that passage of Virgil, iu
which he says:

coelum condidit umbra

 

jupiter, et rebus nox abstulit atra colorem.
AEx. vi. v. 271·
Jove o'er the heavens incumbent shadows stream,
And pitchy midnight robs the world qfhues.

Ver. 7 59. All λιπες, morco’er, to all by turns convert ,·]
No assertion can be more strictly consonant with the

mary, or simple, and secondary or heterogenous : the
former consisting of all those produced by rays of
light possessed of an equal degree of refrangibility‚
and an equal magnitude of their parts, as violet,
indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, and red: the
latter, of all others compounded of the primary ones,
or of a mixture of rays differently refrangible. But
it is a curious fact, that even in the prismatic series
of the seven original colours above enumerated, the
middle colour of any three, in the order in which
they occur, may be produced by a mixture of the
two extremes: thus, a mixture of violet and blue
gives us an indigo; indigo and green, a blue3 blue
and yellow, a green: and in this manner, each, as
our poet observes, would convert to each, till the
entire series was finished ; when, if we were to pur·
sue the experiment‚ it would again appear, that the
last in the order, being red, combined with the se-
cond in the order, being indigo, would still produce
the middle colour of the two, being, in this case,
violet. It is probable‚ however, that Lucretius had
his eye more immediately directed, in the present as-
sertion, to colours refracted from the laminae of
shells and spars, or the plumes of pigeons and pea-
cocks; where, from a cause that will shortly be ex-

diseoveries of modern philosophy. Colours, accord· plained, the sight is perpetually beholding a conver-
ing to the Newtonian theory, are of two kinds, pri· sion of one colour into another. But the prima!
