DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. 11.

Quae puerei in tenebris paV1tant‚ finguntque futura.

Hunc igitur terrorem animi, tenebrasque, necesse est,

Non ⁴radiei solis, neque lucida tela diei,

Discutiant3 sed Naturae species, Ratioque.

Nunc age, quo metu genitalia materiai

Corpora res varias gignant, genitasque resolvant3

Ver. 5 ς. For as the boy, when midttight veils the εἰὶσε,
Trembles, and starts ιιι all things, so, full ost,

Ee'n in the naon, men star! ] Seneca has

quoted the two Latin lines corresponding to this

version, in his Epic—tle 112, and has endeavoured
He seems to appre-

 

to refute their illustration.
hend, that the poet meaned to throw the blame of
all the errors, into which men are perpetually plung-
ing, upon their peculiar frame and constitution ;
and he is hence anxious to exculpate the Deity from
a charge which, as the creator of mankind, would
necessarily attach to him. “ We do not start‚” says
he, “ whilst iu the light ; but, unfortunately,we have
made every thing dark around us : we therefore see
nothing whatever ; neither what will injure, nor what
will benefit us. But we may acquire light, if we
chuse it3 and hence alone may we acquire it—by
the study of those things which relate to God and
man.’' Non timemus in luce, Lucreti, sed omnia
nobis fecimus tenebras‚'' &c. This opposition to
our poet is altogether idle, and unworthy a philoso-
pher of Seneca's talents ε the fact of error, as specis-led
by himself, is the same which was before specified
by Lucretius; and the means of avoiding such error
is the same likewise—-the study of “Truth and lVisdom.

In direct repugnaqce to the taste and judgment of
Seneca, Lucretius himself appears to have been par—
ticularly pleased with this simile : for he has reintro-
duced it both into the third and sixth book, and that
without altering a syllable. See book iii. 55, and

hook vi. 35-

Ver. 58.
By darkness conjur'd,

 

phantoms false
] The facetious But-

ler has some humorous verses to the fame effect,

 

which the reader will not be displeased with perus-
ing in this place*-

Who would believe what strange bugbears
Mankind creates itself of fears?
'shat'spring, like fern, that insect weed,
Equivocally, without seed ;

And have no possible foundation

But merely in th’ imagination ;

And yet can do more dreadful feats

Than hags, with all their imps and teats,
Make more bcwitch, and haunt themselves,
Than all their nursery of elves.

Humn. Part III. iii. 1.

Ver. 60. A terror this the radiant daris of day] A
favourite metaphor with our poet, as I have already
observed. See note on b. i. 166. In the Complaint
of Titus Andronicus, an old poem introduced into
Dr. Percy’s collection, we meet with a figure not
very dissimilar :

I shut my arrowes towards heaven high,

And for revenge to hell did often cry.

This couplet is, however, obviously taken from
Psalm lxiv. 3, 4.

Hide me from the plots‘of the malignant—
Who whet their tongues like a sword ;
And aim poisonous words, like [ιη-στω,
