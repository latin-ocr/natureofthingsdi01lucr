Boox III. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 417

Each vital organ,——till‚ through every bone,
E'en to its central marrow, winds‚ in turn,
The sinuous raptum, or the sense of pain. 260
Yet pain, thus deep within, can never pierce
With keen corrosion, but the tota] man
Shakes from his basis—life no more subsist5‚
And the light soul through every pore flies off.
Hence less profound descends, in general ills, 265
Th’ excited action, and man still survives.
And here, in phrase appropriate, would we prove
In what firm bonds, what various modeS‚ the make

Of each with each commixes, but the dearth
Of terms select restrains us ; yet attend 270

While thus our utmost efforts We essay.
Each primal substance, then, with each coheres

In every act so firm that nought conceiv’d

Can sever 3 nought can central space admit 3

But as the powers they live of one joint frame. 27 5
s As the fresh victim blends in every limb

Hem, taste, and odour, while the total builds

But one compacted mass, so here, alike,

But one same nature flows from hear and air,
