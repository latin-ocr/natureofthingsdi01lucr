ΤΗΕ NATURE OF THINGS.

53

Or live o’er lapsing ages victor still ?
Why, but because primordial matter, fixt

And limited in act, to all is dealt

235

Of things created, whence their forms expand.

And hence again we learn, and prove express,
Nought springs from nought, and that, from seeds precise,

VVhate'er is form'd must meet th’ etherial day.

Mark how the cultur’d soil the soil excells

240

Uncultur'd, richer in autumnal fruits.

Here, too, the latent principles of things,
Freed by the plough, the fertile glebe that turns

And subjugares* the sod, exest their power,

And swell the harvest: else, spontaneous‚ all

245

Would still ascend by labour unimprov'd.

And as from nought the genial seeds of things

Can never fise, so Nature that dissolves

Their varying forms, to nought can ne'er reduce.

ean spring from nothing,'’ our philosophie poet
now ventures to advance a second, and maintains
that “ nothing can ever be annihilated, or reduced
to nothing.'' This axiom he supports by four: argu-
ments, which extend to verse 306. According to
the constitution of Nature, not a single substance
can be dissolved, or even change its texture, without
the interposition of some foreign and superior force.
But if an things were perishable throughout, and
subject to utter annihilation, no such foreign force
would be necessary3 and we should, in a variety of
instances‚ be eye-witnesses of the sudden evanescence

no regular return os anterior productioris 3-—produc-
tions which have been exhibited at definite intervals,
and without any variation, through an incalculable
series of years, and which must, therefore, for aught
that appears to the contrary, on the first view of such
producfions, continue to be exhibited for ever.
Were not this a fact,-were all things perishable, and
equally perishabk, a similar degree of sudden and
external force would divide their contexture, and all
would equally vanish in a moment: nor could
we trace, in that erse, the uniform inter-change

of substance into substance3 follow up its dis-

of substances we had falsely deemed solid: Thus, junction or dissolution; and predict in what form,

too, if, upon the gradual or ultimate decay of things,
every atom were completely destroyed, there could be

'and at what definite period, it would next appear

before us.
