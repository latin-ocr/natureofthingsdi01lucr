has been more fortunate injts researches, than the ano

ignis fatuus, or will-o'-the-whisp, is nothing more than
an exhalation of hydrogen, or inflammable gass, from
the surface of bogs, fens, and other putrescent bodies,
conflagrated by the electricity of the atmosphereg
most generally, perhaps, by the falling star itself.
