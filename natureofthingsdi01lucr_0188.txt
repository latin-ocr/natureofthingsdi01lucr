Morte obita quorum tellus amplectitur ossa.

Nec me animi fallit, Graiorum obscura reperta

Difficile inlustrare Latinis versibus esse ;

Multa novis verbis praesertim quom sit agundum

Propter egestatem linguae, et rerum novitatem:

Sed tua me virtus tamen, et sperata voluptas

needed, and whence, perhaps, he took the idea 3——
the apparition, 1 mean, of the fingers ofa man’s hand
writing‘ mystical characters upon the wall, in the
palaee of Belshazzar, in the midst of the banquet he
was giving to all the nobles of his empire, and their
ladies. The whole is related with inimitable excel-
lence in the book of Daniel, and comprizes almost
every striking circumstance, and every solemn touch,
that can render a story impressive. The splendour
of the scene, the high rank and number of the com-
pany present, the gross impiety and sacrilege they
were guilty of, the abruptness of the apparition, the
extreme terror and perturbation of the king, and the
undaunted probity and resolution of the prophet in
decyphering the occult symbols, are all of them most
interesting parts of the picture, and harmoniously
combine in producing dramatic effect.

The popular mythologies that have most indulged
in praeternatural appearances of this sort, are those
of Odin and Fingal : the former constituting an early
ereed of the Northern countries on the continent; and
the latter, of the inhabitants of Ireland and the High-
lands of Scotland. Each of these systems of super-
stition are possessed of a sublimity and terrible gran-
dem, sar beyond what the inythology of Greece can
lay claim to z but there is a savage ferocity attendant
upon the former, which is repressive to all the feelings
ofa cultivated mind. The spirits of the departed‚
that assemble in the ac'rial hall of the Scandinavian

deity, are represented as fighting and massacring
each other for amusement, and as drinking a spirituous
beverage out of the hollow skulls of their enemies ·—-
while the spirits of the Celtic warriors‚ on the con-
trary, are delineated as regaling themselves with the
hymns of their bards, attuned in praise of love,
friendship, or heroism. Often‚ too, these latter are
supposed to be flying on the wings of the winds, to
warn those whom they esteem on earth of future dan-
gem, or to protect them beneath the pressure of im-
mediate calamities. Nothing is, therefore, more
common than the belief of such benignant appari-
tions ; nothing more frequent than their introduction
in the sublime poems of Ossian : and in the utmost
regions of the Highlands, and the Hebrides, the
same idea is still interwovcn with the profession of
the Christian religion, at the present moment. Fin-
gal, however, admitted no supernatural agency into
his Celtic creed. It is probable the superstition
which he systematized‚ he originally deduced from
the Druids; but he rejected all their barbarities, and
only retained their sacred order of bards, to whom
was paid the utmost degree of reverence. The spirit
of the Fingalian, immediately upon his decease, took
its flight involuntarily to the banks of the river Loda:
if vinnons, οι· heroic, it was there instantaneously
met by'the ghosts of its forefathers, and conveyed
with rapidity to the great hall of the founder of the
race, and claimed its seat among the blest 3 but if it
