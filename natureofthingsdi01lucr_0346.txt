· 4ΒΕ RERUM NATURA.

Lm. ΙΙ.

Si cessare putas rerum primordia posse,

Cessandoque novos rerum progignere motus;

Avius a vera longe ratione vagaris.

Nam, quoniam per inane vagantur, cuncta necesse est

Aut gravitate sua ferri primordia rerum,

Aut ictu forte alterius: nam, concita, saepe,

Obvia quom flixere, fit, ut divorsa repente

Dissiliant : neque enim mirum, durissima quae sint,

Ponderibus solidis, neque quidquam a tergo ibus obstet.

Et, quo jactari magis omnia materiai

Corpora pervideaS, reminiscere, totius imum

Nihil esse in summfu neque habere, ubi corpora prima

Consistant: quoniam spatium sine fine modoque est,

by Pausanias, as also by the scholiast on Aristopha-
neS, in his comedy of ‘⁶ the Frogs.’' The dexterity
of the contest consisted in keeping the lamp or torch
bnrning, during the rapidity evinced by the differ-
ent candidates in running. He who first reached the
goal with his lamp burning, was proclaimed victor-3
and the rest successively resigned their lamps to him
in the order in which they arrived, as so many tro-
phies acquired in the competition. Plato has an
allusion to the same public sporta, in his treatisc de
Legibus, Γινωντες και εκτρεφοντες asangm, καθαπερ λαμ-ποιὲα
τον ,Bima παραδιδοντες αλλοις εξ αλλων : ‘⁸ engenderlng and
rearing children, and in this manner delivering down
life, as a lamp, from man to man.''

The former part of this passage, which is designcd

to prove the existence of a perpetual motion in mate-
rial atonis, although this motion be not always con-

spicuous, is well imitated by ovid, in liis Metamor-
phoses:

 

Rerumque novatrix

Ex aliis alias reparat natura figuras ι

Nec perit in tanto quicquam, mihi credite, mundo,
Μετ. 15- v. 25²·
for nature knows

No stedfast station, but or ebbs, oi· flows;

Ever in motion, she destroys her old,

And casts new figures in another mould. Davum.

Sed variat, faciemque novat.

 

The melancholy muse of Young has expressed
the same idea in terms so appropriate, but at the
same time so totally different, that I shall take the
liberty of quoting his description foi· a comparison
with those of Lucretius and Ovicl :

VVhere is the dust that has not been alive?

The spade, the plough disturb our ancestors;
