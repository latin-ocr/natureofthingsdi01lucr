THE NATURE OF THINGS'.

189

A thousand lamps irradiate, propt sublime

By frolic‘ forms of youths in massy gold,

25

Flinging their splendours o’er the midnight feast ε

Though gold and silver blaze not o'er the homi,

Nor music echo round the gaudy roof?

Yet listless laid the velvet grass along

Near gliding streamS‚ by shadowy trees o'er-arch’d‚

30

Such pomps 'we need not3 such still less when spring

Leads forth her laughing nain, and the Warm year

Paints the green meads with roseat flowers profuse.

On down reclin’d, or wrapp’d in purple robe

The thirsty fever burns with heat as fierce

Nor glittering pomp, nor guards of state
Can soothe the sighing beart,

Nor from the mansions of the great
Bid hovering cAREs depart.

Linnfeus, in his Flora Lapponica, has given us a
description of Lapland manners, so generally coinci-
dent with this beautiful picture of still life, as con-
trasted with the riotous pleasures of the world,
that Ι can have no doubt the philosophie botanist
had his eye turned to our own poet at the time he
wrote it. It commences, indeed, with an obvious
imitation of Virgil, in a passage which Virgil most
unquestionably deduced from Lucretius. O sortu-
natos nimium! sua si bona norint, διε. O felix
Lappo! qui in ultimo angulo mundi sic bene lates
contentus et innocens.·—-Tu dormis hic sub tua pelle
ab omnibus curis, contentionibus, rixis liber, igno-
rans quid sit invidia. 'Tu ducis innocentissimos tuos
annos ultra centenarium numerum cum facili senec-
tute, et summa* sanitate. Te latent myriades morborum
nostris Europaeis communes. Tu vivis in sylvis, avis
instar, nec sementem facis, nec metis, tamen alit
tc Deus opu'mus optime. Tua ornamenta :unt tre-

mula arborumsolia graminosique luci. Tuus potus aqua
crystallinae pelluciditatis.—Te non obruit scorbutus‚
nec fibris intermittens, nec obesitas, nec podagra3
fibroso gaudes corpore et alacri animoque libero. O
saneta innocentia, estne hic tuus thronus inter Faunos
in summo septentrione, inque velissima habita terra?
numne sic praefers stragula haec betulina mollibus se.
nio tectis plumis? Sic etiarn credidere veteres, nec
male. “ Ο happy Lappian ! who thus hidest thyselfin
the remotest corner of the earth, content and innocent.
Thou reposest under thy bear-skin, void of all strife‚
contention, or care, and altogether ignorant of en-
vy. Thou extendest thine innocent years beyond a
century, happy in an easy age, and Vin thesullsruition
of health. From thee are hidden the myriads qs diseases
that are common to us more enlightened Europeans.
Thou livest ἱη the woods like a bird, neither sowing nor
reaping; but God, most benevolent, nourishes thee
most benevolently. ‘Thine ornaments are the tremulous
foliage of trees, and the grassy shades : thy beverage, the
stream ofcrystal transparency. Thee, the scurvy de-
stroys not, nor the intermittiugfever‚ nor unwieldy
corpulence, nor the gout ς thou rejoicest in a body
