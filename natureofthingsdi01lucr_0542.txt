DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. III.

Atque oculei, partes animantis totius exstant.

Quam vis multa quidem sapientum turba putarunt

Sensum animi certa non esse in parte locatum3

tinction of their existence, they wisely endeavoured
to improve‚ to the utmost of their ability, the first,
and to fortify and prepare themselves against the ap-
proach of the second. The sources of consolation,
which were open to them, are still open to us, and by
no means unworthy of our attention3 although, with
the christian scriptures in our hands, they are not the
only, nor even the richest, consolations which are ad-
dressed to us. With these sources the present book
concludes, and 1 think I may add. that there is not a
readcr, whatever be his religious creed, who, upon
a perusal of them, will not derive an equal degree of
giatification and improvement. The celebrated Es-
say on Man, by Mr. Pope, is founded on the same
principles, and altogether as destitute in its appeal to
a state of future existence; but the motives to con-
tentment and resignation, advanced by Pope, bear
no comparison with those exhibited by Lucre-
tius. They are less animated, less cogent, less inte-
resting, and less applicable. See note on Book ΙΙ.

v. 874.

Ver. 100. First, then, the mind,
F orms qs this morta! mal-e α part as clear
As the been eye, the finger, or the foot.] Mr.
Locke’s sentiments upon this subject are known to
every one. Locke was an immaterialist ; but he ap-
pears to have approximated the doctrine of Berkcley‚
in denying that we have any clear idea of the sub-
stance of matter, and that all our knowledge of it
results from our ideas of a certain combination of
primary and secondary qualities, connected with the
idea of an aptitude in such qualities to give or receive
alterations. (See Essay on Hum. Unders. Book II.
chap. 23.) Having thus dcclared our ignorance as
to the substance of matter, he advances a step far-

 

ther, and asserts, with our own poet, that we have
. no reason to pronounce matter incapable of thinking ς
and that, for any thing that appears to the contrary,

it is as capable of intelligence as of any other 'pro-
perty. But why then have recourse to an immate-
rial spirit, if matter alone be competent to all the
phaenomena of intelligence and thought without it?
The dilemma is obvious ; and it has been repeatedly
observed of Mr. Locke, that he must have been a
materialist, if he had abided by the legitimate conse-
quences of his own reasoning. The principles upon
which he argues are entirely those of the Epicurean
school; and Polignac‚ in his Anti—Lucretius, has
attacked him with no small degree of asperity, and
certainly, with no small degree of success, for his
incongruity in this respect:

Mirari, satis hic nequeo, quis tetricus horror,
Despectusque sui, quae mortis prava libido ἓ
Lymphatas hominum mentes incesserit, ut se,
Corpore mortales cum sint natique sepulchro,
Mortales animo esse velint penitusque caducos.
Tantus amor nihili! tanta est vecordia!

Auri-Luca. Β. ν. 10042.

With mute surprize 1 mark this dread de-
prav’d,

This sels-contempt, this low-born lust of death

That goads the cheated minds of men to wishf

Since born to die, and mortal in the flesh,

The soul may too be mortal‚ and expire-

Of blank annihilation such their love !

Their madness such !

The name of Locke is not mentioned by Po-
lignac in this passage, although it occurs in several
others: but M. Bougainville, the translator of the
poem into French, who was intimately acquainted
with the cardinal during the greater part of the
time of his writing it, tells us openly, in his prefixed
abstract, that Locke was the philosopher against
whom this passage was immediately directed; and it
cannot be denied, that the doctrines it refers to
were his own.
