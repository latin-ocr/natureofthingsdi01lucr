BooK ΙΙΙ. THE NATURE 010¹ THINGS. 403

Mid many a bone, tremendous‚ winds its way,

Quick saints the spirit :-—a fond wish to die

Now sways, and now the native love of life.

Material‚ hence, the mental frame must live, 18 5

Since by material arms so soon assail'd.

Now list attentive, while we next unfold
Its make mysteriOUS, and to sight educe.
First‚ then, we firm maintain the mind results
From seeds of matter, most minute and smooth. 1 90
This hence we prove, that nought so swiftly speeds
As what the mind determines and completes ; Α

The mind, whose keen rapidity o'erpowers

Si pedibus cessere tuis, ratione carebunt : Like other mgans, its appropriate food ;

Pectoris at mediam regionem si tetigere, As through the frame each limb its food de-

Qa nostrae placuit tibi mentis templa locari, mands.

Tunc disceptabunt de mundo, et origine rerum, Hence thrives the mind through all its inmozt

Ac de sorte sua : sint corpora dedita leto, make,

Necne ; quid ad vitam possit conferre beatam: As through its inmost make each membrane

Jus populis dicent, ornabunt legibus orbem, thrives.

Invida quarn natura negat, positura dabit vim. So crumbs of bread‚ once swallow’d and absorb’d,
Auri-Luca. Lib. V. ν. 531. And haply through the blood's meand'ring tube

See from new motions, new arrangements‚ see, VVand’ring—if to the foot their course they bend

What matter sole can gender. Different sites, Know nought of reason 3 but is once they retich,

Change as they may, or figures, I can sound; O’erjoy’d‚ the midmost bosom, where alone

But mind 1 trace not still, nor miud’s results. The mind thou own'st its mystic temple builds,

And hence enrag’d, Ι mark thee, the pure mind Of fate they argue, and the world’s first rise

Strive from the body, like the brain t' educe 3 And birth of nature ; whether death destroy

Strive from a mass to rear it, of themselves Or not for ever ; what may best promote

Whose separate atoms ne’ei· to mind pretend z The bliss of life ; desine the rights of man

Enrag’d, l mark, and reason rages too. And plan for nations harmonizing laws.

Yet, if organic be thy mind, it crasse-u So problcms prove what jealous nature shrowds.
