THE NATURE OF THINGS.

293

Mid the deep shade of night, by touch alone

Prove what surrounds us„ every hue extinct.

All hues, moreo'er‚ to all by turns convert ;

A change primordial seeds can ne'er sustain 3

Since something still through nature must exist

All change defying, lest th’ ENTIRE survey'd‘

Fall into nought3 for that which once admits

Mutation dies, its pristine pow'rs destroy'd.—-—

Tinge, then, with cantion, the prime seeds of thingS,

atoms of matter, as he has before endeavoured to
demonstrate, can suffer no change whatsoever: con-
sequently, such mutations of colour could not pos-
sibly occur, if such primal atoms themselves were
essentially coloured; for neither could red seeds be-
come blue, nor orange, green 3 nor could a mixture
of any two whatsoever, produce a third different in
colour from the two so combined.

From this theory, moreover, and the production
of any middle colour in the prismatic series, from
its two extremes, we may be able to solve a ques-
tion, which Ι do not know has been hitherto solved
by any philosopher:—why is green so much more
pleasant and reposing a colour to the eye than any
other? The probable reason is, that from its form-
ing the middle of the seven primary colours, it par-
takes more equably of the nature of all the rest than
any individual colour besides can do.

This doctrine, however, of the existence of seven
primax-y colours in solar light, has, by no means,
been uniformly admitted on the continent. Father
Castel appears to have been the first who attempted
to reduce the seven colours to three : he contended,
that the blue, yellow, and red, were competent to
all the phaenomena of optics; and that the whole
compass of tints and shades of tints may be produced
by a binary combination of those elements in different
proportions. The theory of Castel was improved

765

by Mayer, who formed an equilateral tffiangle, of
which each side was divided into twelve parts3 the
whole, in this manner, containing ninety-one cells
or square compartments, omitting the small trian-
gular spaces left on the upper margins. The three
extreme cells were blue, yellow, and red3 and the
intermediate cells marked the series of gradations;
those on the sides, the double combination; and
those of the interior, the triple combination‚ accord-

ing to their respective distances from the apices.
The celebrated Lambert remarked, that the effects
were modified by the vivacity of the colouring ma-
terials3 and that it was requisite to state previously
whether those were to be apportioned by their bulk or
their weight. M. Achard succeeded in writing an ela-
borate essay· on the same theory: and finally, M.
Burja has attempted to show, that though white
should result from a mixture of these primary co-
lours, it requires the blue and red to be joined to an
excess of yellow. The binary compounds are best
produced by a mixture of equal parts, by weight,
of the elementary tints ; and the process may be re-
peated with the results, so as to afford any number
of inter-mediate shade33 which again may be dark-
ened at pleasure, by the addition of similar mixrures
of black and white. Memoires de l'Acade'mie Roy*
