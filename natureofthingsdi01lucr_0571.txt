THE NATURE OF THINGS.

421

One frame harmonious, lest the power of air,

Of hear, or vapour, each from each disjoin'd,

295

Mar all sensation, and fly off dissolv’d.

Heat springs superior in the mind enrag’d,

When burns the total system, and the eye

Darts forth its lurid lightnings : vapour chill

Th' ascendance gains when fear the frame pervades,

300

And ruthless HORROR, shiv’ring every limb 3

While the pure air, of tranquillizing power,

Smooths all the visage, and the soul serenes.

Heat sways, as urg'd already, in the form

With acrid breast, that rouses soon to ire3

305

Chief in the rampant lion, whose proud heart

Bursts with impetuous roaring, nor can bound

m

preponderance of one element, but of two com-
bined, and this, therefore, introduced another class
of temperaments, or rath'er doubled the original
number3 for we had noim, sanguineous‚ phlegmatic‚
melancholic, and bilious: the first proceeding from
a mixt prevalence of heat and moisture ; the second,
of cold and moisture3 the third, of dryness and
cold ; the fourth, of dryness and heat. The tempe-
raments of Galen, however, with many of his other
doctrines, have been falling, during the present cen-
tury, into considerable disrepute; although Boer-
haave contended that such a division was not desti-
tute οἱ its use in medicine : ‘⁴ ›Siwuyzparfmss' says he,
*ἒ vel sanitatis temperies proinde difficulter ad singu-
laria capita determinari potest 3 sed tamen proposita
antiquis divisio in temperiem calidam, Sec. aliquem
in medicina usum habet.” Instit. Medic. sect. 889.
As the doctrine of Aristotle and Galen, concern-
ing Temperaments‚ has been sinking into oblivion,

that of Epicurus has had various efforts made for its
revival. One of the most strenuous attempts I have
ever witnessed, though apparently without any direct
reference to the passage before us,is in avolume written
a few years ago, by Dr. Oakley of Northampton, and
entitled, Pyrology. In this singular and fanciful disser-
tation, the author boldiy undertakes to prove, that au
the varieties of moral and pliysical idiosyncracie8‚ or
constitutions we meet with, result alone from the dif-
ferent proportions of elementary heat, or caloris, (ca—
lor is the term employed by our own poet‚) that in-
sinuares itself into the frames of different persons.-
and that, merely upon this difference of proportioni,
it depend3‚ whether a man will be possessed of indo-
lence, activity‚ wit, or madness.
