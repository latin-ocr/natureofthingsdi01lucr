lxm THE LlFE OF LUCRETIUS.

thing could be created out of nothing. The Epicuream, and many
011101· 50110015 of philosophers‚ who borrowed it from them, perpetu-
ally appeal to this position. It originated, perhaps, with Democritus,
who expressly asserted, according to Diogenes Laertius, ‘⁶ that nothing
could spring from nothing, 01· could ever return to 110t11i11g⁵÷.'' Epi-
curus echoed the tenet in the following terins: “ Know first of all, that
nothing can spring from 11011-011111γνῗῖ1 It was thus given by Aristo-
tlc: ‘⁶ 'I'o suppose what is created to havc been created from no-
thing, is to ‹livest it, of all power; for it is a dogma of those who
thus pretend to think that every thing must still* possess its own> ua-
tiii'e1}1.'' From the Greeks it passed to the Romans, and appears as
follows, in Lucretius:

Admit this trnth that nought from nothing springs,
And all is clear §-

And it was thus, long aftcrwards, recorded by Persius:

Nought springs from nought‚ and can to nought return Η.

It. is singular, that 1110 very sanic reason is advanccd among 1110
Bramins, and is thus urged, in identic ternis, in an Upanishad, from
the Yajur Vcda, 111 the course of an address to Brmnah, or the Su-
premo Being: “ 1110 ignorant assert, that the universe, 111 the begin-
ning, did not exist in its author, and that it was created out os uo-
thing. O ye whose hearts are pure, how could something arise out qf‘
nothing {l ?”
