Yet should we grant that matter, without end,

For ever wastes3 e'en then, from earliest time,

Some matter must have triumph’d undecay’d,

Cohering still ε but what can thus cohere,

What brave th' unnumber'd repercussions felt

Alike the future conqu'ring'as the past.

k Hence those who dcem the fabric of the world

to preserve it in a pure and active flame upon the
national altar. When, therefore, the Jews were
borne away in captivity to Persia, the priests took the
sacred fire of the altar aad concealed it in a dry cave,
with which none but themselves were acquainted3
and where, on their restoration to liberty, the poste-
rity of those priests found it on their return to Judaea.
(Maccab. 2. 1. 18.) Fire was regarded with an equal
degree of veneration throughout Greece and Rome.
Temples in every city were erected to the goddess
Vesta—a name importing fire, whether derivedfrom the
Grecian εςτιοι, or the Hebrew κῃωκ, and in every
temple a lambent flame was perpetually burning over
the altar. And even so late as in the third century
of the Christian era, when Heliogabalus anticipated
his own apotheosis, and instituted the worship of
himself over all the Roman empire, having erected a
magnificent temple to his own divinity, he supplied
its altar with sacred fire from the temple of Vesta,
which he plundered for this purpose.

We cannot be much surprized, therefore, that a
belief so common among the people, should become
a frequent doctrine among the philosophers-—and
that all things should be supposed to originate from
rire as an clement, instead of from fire as a god. Such
was the opinion of Heraclitus, who rendered himself

more celebrated than any other sage of the Pyrean
Vox.. Ι,

school, by the eloquent, but obscure and dogmatic
manner with which he wrote upon this subject. In
modern times, the same tenet has been frequently
started afresh; and if not pressed to the full extent
to which it was carried by Heraclitus, exhibiting
such intimate marks of analogy and association as
perpetually to remind us of the Heraclitaean system.
Buffon supposed the whole earth to have been at first a
complete body of liquid fire ; and to have consisted of
a comet, and a portion of the sun's exterior limb car—
ried off by such comet, in consequence of its having
given the sun an obliquestroke in the course ofits orbit-
At itsfirst origin, therefore, the earth, upon this system,
was nothing more than a large vitreous mass in a state
of fusion. This state of fusion constituted the chaos of
which every nation has some tradition : and from the
chaotic mass, as it became gradually cool, the earth
in its present state was progressively developed. He
conceived this operation to have been the work of

a multitude of ages, and endeavoured to reconcile the
chronology of Moses with that of the Pundits of
Hindustan, by conjecturing that while the former
only begins his date from the period when the earth
first became habhablc, the latter calculate from thr¹
earliest origin of the globe in its state of liquid heat.
To detail the arguments which have been ad‘
duced in opposition to this and similar systems, would
