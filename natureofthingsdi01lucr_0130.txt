What considerably added to the confusion of this Babel edifice
was, 'that from the growing reputation of the Christian church, vthe
purity of its principles, and the incontrovertible miracles which had
been vvrought by many of its earliest professors‚ Christianity and Ju-
daism had both been studied as philosophie sciences, and many of their
doctrines been suffered to intermingle in the general mass. In conse-
quence of which, multitudes of the earlier Christians themselves were
induced to frequent Alexandria3 where, in too many instances, they
caught the common contagion, ancl vcombined the mysteries of mo-
dernized Platonism with the simple precepts oftheir own creed. Hence
'the writings of Athenagoras and Clemens Alexandrinus abound with
pagan doctriues3 and they themselves, as well as Pantaenus and Am-
monius, were all successively instructors in the catachetic school in
this metropolis, Ammonius, however, in process of time, apostatised
from the Christian faith 3 and his immediate followers, Plotinus, Porphy-
ην, and Jamblichus‚ became in succession its most inveterate adver-
saries: yet it is probable that their attachment to Christianity would
have rendered it more dissei-vice than their eumity ; for though possest
of considerable learning, they were all, in the highest degree, mystagogues
and enthusiasts; Plotinus contending with violence for the doctrine of
divine emanation, and, as connected herewith, the worship of gods,
daemon& genii, and heroes ; Porphyry, for the purgative exercise of cor-
poreal abstinences and mortifications; and Jamblichus surrendering
himself without restraint to all the superstitious practices of divination.
The early connection of some parts of the Christian church with
Oriental gnosticism, a belief which in many respects approximated
that of Platonism, and paved a way for the reception of the latter,
shews clearly how liable Christianity was to debasement from its
earliest propagation, in consequence of the law-less sway of human
passions and opinionS, ancl how much more it would have suffered
from the friendship than from the hostility of such hallucinated phi-
Iosophers,
