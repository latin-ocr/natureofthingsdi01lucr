FRoM the nature and properties of atoms‚ discussed in the two preceding books, the
Poet advances to a more detailed account of their results under different states of
combination and modification. The book opens with a panegyric upon Epicurus;
and a brief sketch of its chief object, viz. to root from the heart that undue attachment
to life, which is the source of many of the worst passione of the soul. Of the nature
of the soul t—its chief residence in and about the beart 3 its general extension to the
body at large; in what sense it may be said to differ from the mind, and in what to
be synonymous with it. That the soul is altogether material, and compounded of
different gases inhaled from the atmosphere: in consequence of its materiality‚ that it
is mortal‚ and perishes with the body. The anxiety and terror of mankind upon
contemplating the prospect of death, whether as a state of annihilation, or of future
punishment. No truth in the popular mythological fables respecting a posterior state of
torment 3--and hence, the absurdity of any undue anxiety on either account. The best
means of moderating such anxiety‚ and consequently, of giving to life its truest relish

nnd enjoyment.
