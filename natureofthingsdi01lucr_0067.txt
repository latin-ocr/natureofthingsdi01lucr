THE LIFE OF LUCRETIUS. liii

Yet, notwithstanding this wise and salutary restriction, it is im-
possible to conceive, that any inan could, without personal danger,
encounter the animosity of so numerous and powerful a body as those
religious orders must have formed, by the propagatim] of doctrines,
avowedly subversive of their entire constitution. The most violent
demagoguo never dared attempt it: and consuls, trihuneS, praetors,
and quaestors, found it equally for their interest, whatever may have
been the infidelity of their heartS, to reverence the established system.
Lucretius, however, like an honest man, and one who could not look,
without contempt, upon the absurd superstitions of his country,
hazarded the danger, and was determined to employ, both the force
of argument, and the chartus of poetic imagery, to convince the re⁴²
public of its errorS. He tells his eountrymen, that they need never
be afraid of sound and genuine philosophy: that philosophy can by
no means introduce vice and immorality into the world3 but that
their own absurd and abominable superstitious might do, and often
had done 50. And, in proof of this latter assertion, he adverts to, and
relates, in a masterly manner, the story of the sacrifice of Iphigenia, in
consequence of the demand of such an oblation, by the pretended
goddess Diana ‘² He informs them, that they need not be afraid of
forsaking the altars of their gods, from any idea that these imaginary
heings could punish them for apostaey; for that Epicurus himself, the
most undaunted of all the philosophers, and upon whom, had they
possessed any power whatever, they would doubtless have wrecked
their utmost vengeanee, had never sustained any detriment in conse-
quence of his religious opinions.

No thunder him, no fell revenge pursu'd

Of heav’n incens’d, or deities in arins.

Urg’d, rather, by such bugbear threats, to press,
With firmet· spirit, forward through the bounds
Of nature, close conceal’d 3 the flaming walls

θ’ Book I. v. 69.
