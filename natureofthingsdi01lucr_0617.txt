THE NATURE OF THINGS.

Anterior, with the body3 and hence, too,

Both must alike be mortal, since alike

To parts divisible with equal ease.

Grant, too, the soul immortal‚ and infus'd,

At earliest birth, within us—wherice, resolve,

This full oblivion of all past eventS‚

All former life ?——for if the soul so change,

That nought remains of mem’ry in its make,

ι A change so total differs scarce from death.

Thus, what before existed, must have ceas’d,

685

And on its ruins sprung what now exists.

for he had been in both sexes of the human race, as
well as in the bodies of birds and fishes. While the
latter maintained, that he had been present at, and
had pai-taken in the toils of the Trojan war, occupy-
ing at that period the body of Euphorbus, who was
ssain by Menelaus; that he was afterwards infused
into the body of another hero, of the name of AEtha-
lides : that he then possessed the corporeal tabernacle
of a fisherman 3 that he afterwards resided, for more
than two centuries, in the lower regions without any
body at all; and that, at the expiration of this pe-
riod, he was transmitted to the body of Pythagoras
himself. Ridiculous as such a belief may appear at
the present day, the metempsychosis was a doctrine
accredited very generally in earlier periods : it was a
tenet in the creed of the aborigines of our own coun-
try, and still continues to form a part of the belief
of the worshippers, both of Brahma and Budha;
and, of course, to form an article of the established
religions of Hindu, Thibet, Ava, and Ceylon.

In the second volume of Dalrymple's Oriental
Repcrtory, is a most curious and enter-mining paper

 

on “ Transmigration and Final Beatitude,” as taught
by the Bramins. This paper composes a part of
the Institutes of Menu, which were translated from
the Sanskrit by Sir William Jones‚ and printed at
Bengal, at the East-India Company’s expence. It.
is a compendium of the different states and bodies
mankind are to occupy hereafter, agreeably to a re-
gulation dependent upon the moral conduct they
exhibit in the present life. “ For sinful acts,’' says
Bhrigu‚ whose heart was the pure essence of virtue,
“ for sinful acts, that are mostly corporcal, a man
shall assume, after death, a vegetable oi· mineral
form: for such acts, mostly verbal, the form of a
bird or a beast ; and for sinful acts, mostly mental,
the lowest of human conditions,’' Sec.

A similar position is advanced in ver. 554, of the
