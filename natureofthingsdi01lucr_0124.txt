stom each other by concussion ; and sometimes adhering to each other
from their own jagged or pointed construction, or from the casual in-
terstices which two or more connected 3101115 must produce, and which
may just be adapted to those of other configurations, as globular, 0val,
or square. Hence the origin of compound bodies ; hence the origin of
immense masses of matter; hence, eventually, the origin of the world
itself. W'lien these primary atonis are closely compacted together, and
but little vaeuity or space intervenes, they produce those kinds of sub-
stances which we denominate solid, as stoneS, and metuis: when they
are loose and disjoined, and a large quantity of space or vacuity oc-
curs between them, they produce the phaenomena of wool, water, va-
pour. In one mode of combination, they form earth3 in another, air;
and in another, fire. Arranged in one way, they produce vegetation
and irritability; in another way, animal life and perceptionae-B‘Ian
hence arises—families are formed—society multiplieS, and governments
are instituted. “

The. world, thus generated, is perpetually sustained by the‘application
of fresh elementary atoms, flying with inconceivable rapidity through
all the infinitude of space, invisible from their minuteness, and occu-
pying the posts of all those that are as perpetually flying off. Yet,
nothing is eternal and immutable but these elementary seeds or atoms
themselves: the eompound forms of matter are continually decom—
pounding, and dissolving into their original corpuscles t to this there is
no exception z—minerals, vegetables, and animalS, in this respect all
alike, when they lose their present configuration, perishing from ex-
istence for ever, and new combinations proceeding from the matter in-
to which they dissolve. But the world itself is 3 compound, though
not an organized being; sustained and nourished like organized beings ¹
from the material pabulum that floats through the void of infinity,
The world itself must therefore, in the same manner, perish : it had a
