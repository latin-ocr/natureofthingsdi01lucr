THE NATURE OF THINGS.

Or the sunl< grave, by earth's vast pressure crush'd ?

“ But thy deas home shall never greet thee more !

“ No more the best of wives l—thy babes belov'd,

‘⁶ Whose haste half-met thee, emulous to snatch

the funeral dirge which was composed on the occa-
sion. The rowers had been previously instrueted to
perform a part in the solemn service, and they re-
sponded to the elegy with mournful ejaculatious,
while their oars struck in pathetic cadence to the
measure of the sacred music. The history is related
at large in Plutarch's life of this prince.

From vthe universality of this custom of funeral
dirges in all ages, but particularly in the earlier,
Gessner has, with great propriety, introduced it into
the burial service of Abel—the first mortal who ever
felt the stroke of death. The address, on this occa-
sion, is as beautiful as it is pathetic ; and Ι eagerly in-
sert it in the present place, with a view of proving
how superior are the consolations of revealed religion
to the most forcible supports of ancient philosophy :
O wie erb'zirnlich liegt seine hfille da ! du unser
trost, du unser entziicken, Abel! ach du hast uns
verlassen; nnd unser siisses gesch‘afte wird seyn, um
dich zu weinen, bis in die stunde unsers todes nm
dich zu weinen. Ja, du bist hiniibergegangen in die
eeligkeit, deren erwartung dir so manche heilige
thr'an’ entlorkte ς deren enwartung mir so manche thran'
entlockt. O wir weinen dir nach, aus diesem schat-
ten des todes dir nach! du hast uns verlassen, uud
unser siisses gesch’zifte wird seyn, bis in die ge-
wiinschte §tunde des tocies um dich zu wcinen. Death
of Abel, Book V. ‘⁵ O how woeful is the sight of
his extended corse ἔ thou, our consolation, thou, our
delight ! Abel! ah, thou hast left us, and our
sweetest employment shall be to weep over thee ; to
the hour of death to weep over thee. Yes, thou art
now in possession of that felicity‚ the contemplation

of which has drawn from thee so many holy tears3 ·

the contemplation of which has drawn so many tears
from myself. But O! we still weep for thee-—
still weep for thee in these shadows of death l Thou
hast left us, and, till the wished-for honr of death,

we will weep over thee.⁷’

With these two elegantepccimcns of funeral ora-
tion, the rcader may compare that inimitablc (luge,
the first of which wc have any account, contained iu
the lamentation of David ovtr Saul and Jonatlinn.
2 Sam. i. Π). The whole compass of Grecian
poctry has nothing equal to it z

O roe of Israel Ξ slain art thou in [hine own fast-

nesses !

How are the mighty fallen {—

Speak not in Gath ; keup silence in the streets of

Askalon :

Lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice,
Lest the daughters of the uncircutucised triumph.

Mountains of Gilboa! and ye lofty ficlds!

Let neither dew nor rain fall upon you :

For there the useless shield of the mighty was
thrown away ;

The shield of Saul no longer anointed with unction.

From the blood of the brave, from the strength of
the valiant,

The bow of Jonathan recoiled not,

Nor the sword of Saul returned empty.

Worthy os love were Saul and Jonathan,
Dear to each other in their lives,
And in their deaths not divided.
More swift were they than eagles,
More courageous than lions.

Lament, ye daughters of Israel ! over Saul,
Who clothed you in delightful scarlct 3
Who adorned your apparel with golden triukcts.
How are the mighty fallen
In the midst of the battle !

O jonathan! slain hast thou been upon thine
own fastnesses ἔ
Agonized arn I for thee, my brother jonathan ἒ
Delicious hast thou been unto mc ;
Wonderful was thy love for me, beyond the lore
of women.
