ΒοοΚ Ι.

Some happy phrase, some well selected verse,

THE NATURE OF THINGS.

43

160

Meet for the subject3 to dispel each shade,
And bid the mystic doctrine hail the day.

For shades there are, and terrors of the soul‚

The day can ne'er disperse, though blazing strong

With all the sun's bright javelinS.

These alone Ι 65

To Nature yield, and Reason3 and, combin'd‚

This is the precept they for ever teach,

That NOUGHT FROM NOUGHT BY PoW'R DIVtNE HAS Rrs’N.

refer to is that in which the Italian bard describes
the descent of Michael the archangel from heaven,
to the Christian camp, at the command of the Al-
mighty.

Dovunque drizza Michel angel l'ale

Fugon le nubi, e torno il ciel sereno,

Gli gira intorno un aureo cerchio ; quale

Veggiam di notte lampeggiar baleno.
ΟΜ.. Fun. C. xiv.

Where’er his course the radiant envoy steers,

The clouds disperse, the troubled ether clears ;

And round him plays a circling blaze qf light,

Such as when meteors stream through dusky night.
HooLE.

Tertullian, as Mr. Wakefield observes, has intro-
duced this same metaphor of Lucretius into his sec-
tion on Chastity. “ Quibus exquirendis,'’ observes
he, ‘⁴ non lucernae spiculo, lumine sed totius solis lancea,
opus est-’¹ Cap. 7. “ In the investigation of which
“ it behoves us to employ, not the mere shafts of a
‘⁶ candle, but the arrowy light of the whole sun.’'

There is also an introduction of the same elegant
figure in a beautiful and tender passage of Jortin;
the whole of which the reader will find trans-

cribed, on another occasion, in the note on Book iii.
v. 1 136.

Sidera, purpurei telis extincta diei
Rursus nocte vigent.

Kill’d by the arrows qs the purple day,
The stars at night revisit us.

The use of this metaphor, in the description of a
severe frost, is scarcely so bold, and is much more
common. Dyer, however, has introduced it, with
much picturesque effect, in his delineation of a Lap-
land winter.

 

the horrid rage
Of winter irresistible o’erwhelms

The Hyperborean tracts; his arrowysrosts,
That pierce through flinty rocks, the Lappian flies.
Fures, Β. i.

In a similar manner, Milton, in his Paradise Re·
gained τ
How quick they wheel'd ; and, flying, behind
them shot
Sharp sleet of arrowy shower.

Whence Gray, in his Descent of Odin :

Iron sleet ofarrowy shower
Hurtles in the darken’d air.

by Democritus, is frequently referred to by Aristode,
and many other philosophers among the ancients, who
were not immediately of the Epicurean school. It is

thus repeated by Diogenes Laertius, ix. 44. Μηδει
