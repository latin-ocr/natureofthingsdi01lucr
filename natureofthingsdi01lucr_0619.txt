Boox ΙΙΙ, THE NATURE OF THINGS. 469

If the light soul‚ moreo'er, then only join
The full-form'd body, when that body first
Springs into birth, and treads the porch of life,
Ne'er can it then, as though diffus’d at large, 690
E'en with the vital blood, through all the frame,
Grow with each growing member: but confin’d,
As in a den, in solitude must dwell,
From the first hour exciting equal sense.
Hence doubly flows it, souls can ne’er exist 695
Of birth devoid, nor free from final fate.
Nor could they, as each daily fact confirmS,
If from without infus'd‚ the total frame
Fit with such nice precision ε for so close
Blend they with every organ, bone, and nerve, 700
That e'en th’ enamel'd tooth sensation shares ;
As oft its ache evinces, or th' approach
Of ice abrupt3 or when, beneath its gripe‚
Grates some harsh pebble mid the subject food.
Nor thus connected could they e'er retreat 70 5
Safe, and uninjur’d through the sinuous paths
Of organS, membranes, vessels, bones, and nerves.

But, from without, th’ insinuating soul,

The young disease, that must subdue at length, So cast, and mingled with his very fmmc
Grows with his growth‚ and strengthens with his The mind’s disease, its ruling passion came.
