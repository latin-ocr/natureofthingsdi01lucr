Boox III. THE NATURE oF THINGS. 401

Clouds dim the sight, the palsied tongue is mute,
Tingles the ear, and every limb dissolves.
Ost, too, from mental terror saints the frame ;

Whence mayst thou mark how close the bond that knits
The soul and spirit3 this exciting that,

And that, when rous'd‚ deep—rousing every nerve,

Hence prove we, too, that both alike exist 1 70
Corporeal 2—hence, since every member yields
With quick submission to the joint behest:
Since bursts from sleep the body, since the face
Obsequious varies, and the total man
Feels the full sway profound3 for nought can act 1 7 5
VVhere touch subsists not, nor can touch subsist
Void of corporeal base z—can we, then, doubt
That soul‚ that spirit must corporeal spring?
In all, moreo’er‚ of ease or anguish keen
The body feels, th’ assenting mind partakes. 1 30
