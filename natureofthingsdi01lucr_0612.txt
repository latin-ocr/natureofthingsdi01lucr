462 DE RERUM NATURA. Lm. 111.

Ut tremere in terra videatur ab artubus id quod

Decidit abscisum3 quom mens tamen, atque hominis vis, 645
Mobilitate mali non quit sentire dolorem: ,

Et, simul in pugnae studio qui dedita mens est,
Corpore cum reliquo pugnam, caedeisque‚ petessit:
Nec tenet, amissam laevam cum tegmine saepe
Inter equos abstraxe rotas, falcesque rapaceist 6 50
Nec cecidisse alius dextram, quom scandit, et instat.

Inde alius conatur adempto surgere crure,

Quom digitos agitat propter moribundus humi pes:

Here, with worse noise, three thousand chariots
pass,

With plates of iron bound, or londer brass.

About it axes, forkS, and scythes and spears,

Whole magazines of death, each char-iot bears.

there it breaks in, there a whole troop it mows,

And wilh lopt-panting limbs thefield bestrews.

Alike the valiant, and the coward die:

Nor that can e'er resist, nor this can fly. B. iv.

It is said, however, that Cowley is, in this passage,
guilty of an anachronism ; and the paragraph I have
now quoted from Xenophon, is appealed to as a proof
that Cyrus was the inventor of falcated chariots ι yet
it is diffienlt to understand in any other sense the

upon in the books of Joshua and Judges ; and which,

although commonly translated by the doubtful phrase,
‘⁶ chariots of iron‚'' are rendered by the vulgate
“ currussalcati‚’' “ chariotsfitlcated,'' or “ armed with

Nahum, at which period it is certain that the Jews

“His chariots are flaming scythes in the day of his
preparation.’'

tants, horses, and chariots, is well represented by
Virgil :

Tum vero et gemitus morientum, et sanguine in alto
Armaque, corporaque, et permitti caede virorum
Semianimes volvuntur equi : pugna aspera surgit.

Now dying groans are heard ; the fields are strew’d
With falling horses, and are drunk with blood 2
Arms, horses, men, on heaps together lieg
Confus’d the sight, but more consus’d the cry.

It is still more powerfnlly delineatcd by the He-

The clamour of the rattling wheels,
And of the prancing horses,

And of the rebounding chariots 1-—
