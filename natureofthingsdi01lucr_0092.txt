lxxviii THE LIFE OF LUCRETIUS.

our own countrymen, Berkeley and Hume.

But, aster all, why is it an absurdity to suppose that something may
spring from nothing, whcn the proposition is applied to omnipotence?
1 may be answcred, perhapS, because itis a self-eontradiction. But
this is only to argue-*in circulo, for why is it a sels-contradiction ? “ It
is impossible‚” said M. Leibnitz‚ “ for a thing to be, and not to be, at
the same time.'’ This position Ι admit, because the contrary would imply
a sels-contradiction absolute and universal, founded upon the very na-
ture of things, and consequently impossible to be performed by Om-
nipotence itself. But the position that “ nothing can spring from no-
thing‚” is of a very different character z—it is true when applied to
man, but it does not follow that it is true when applied to God. In-
stead of being absolate and universal, it is relative and limited 3 the na-
ture of things does not allow us to reason from it when its reference
is to the latter; and hence, we have no authority to say that it is im-
possible to the Deity‚ or to maintain that an absolute creation out of
nothing is an absurdity and sels-contradiction. It is absurd to sup-
pose that matter does not exist; it is absurd to suppose that it does
exist eternally and independently of the Creator3 it is absurd to sup-

pose that it constitutes the Creator himself: but as it is not absurd
to suppose its absolute formation out of nothing by the exercise of
almighty power, and as one of these four propositions must necessarily
be true, reason should induce us to embrace the last with the same
promptitudo with which we reject the other three.

So far, indeed, from intimating any absurdity in the idea, that mat—
ter may be created out of nothing by the interposition of an almighty
