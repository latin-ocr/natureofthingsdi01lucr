Nam, quaequomque vides hilare grandescere ad auctum,

Paullatimque gradus aetatis scandere adultae,

Plura sibi adsumunt, quam de se corpora mittunt 3

I have before had occasion to notice, in note on ver,
544, of the present book, that, upon the Epicurean
theory, the world itself was regarded as an immense
though disorganized system, and analogically com-
pared, οη account of many of its powers, to the sys-
tem of animals themselves. Yet we must not conceive,
from the verses before us, or any other, in which the
same comparison or allegory is pursued, that Epicu-

animal in its own frame‚ or in any way endowed with
perceptions or ideas.

and that whatever exists is an individual homogeneous
being. Thus too, Pythagoras and Plato speak in
almost the same terms of the universal spirit, while
the Stoics advance the same of the soul of the world,
the spiritus intus, by which all nature exists, and is
supported. And when, in modern times, Spinoza
informs us, that there is no difference of-substances ;
that the whole, and every part of the material world,
is a being necessarily existent, and that God himself
is the universe—he does not essentially differ from the
Stoics, from Pythagoras, or Plato. It is against all
such systems as these, however, whether ancient or
modern, that the Epicurean theory is immediately
directed. With respect to the popular mythology of
his countrymen, Lucretius is perpetually protesting
against, and even, at times, deriding their credulity
as to any divine power possessed by the earth, the
main, or the stars: asserting, that if the multitude
