ΤΗΕ NATURE OF THINGS.

In ceaseless strife,—and fire with crystal lymph.

But primal seeds, whene'er the form of things

Mutual they gendes, must, perforce, aSsume

An unobtrusive nature, close conceal’d,

Lest aught superior rise‚ of power adverse,

And thus th’ harmonious union be destroy⁹d.

Such sages, too, from heav’n‚ and heaven’s bright fires

Maintain that all proceeds : that fire drawn hence

Converts to ether, ether into showers,

And showers benign to earth:

and hence again,

That all from earth returns : first liquid dew,

Then air, and heat conclusive3 changing thus,

850

In ceaseless revolution, changing thus

From heav'n to earth, from earth to heav’n sublime ε

Α change primordial seeds could ne’er sustain.

And dew condensing does her form forego,
And sinks a heavy lump of earth below.

The whole of which opinion appears to have been
derived from the Hindus‚ probably through the
medium of Egypt3 but with this difference, and
ostensible advantage on the part of the Greeks,
that the Hindus instead of deriving air from fire,
and water from air, derive water from fire, and fire
from air. The cosmogony of the Hindus is as fol-
lows: They first suppose a Supreme Deity or Be-
ing of beings 3 then, that this Divinity created Eter-
nity ς that Eternity brought forth Tchiwen ; Tshi-
wen, Tchaddy3 and in this manner, that a regular
succession of divinities was created, till at length,

we arrive at Bruma, or Bremah, being the twelfth

heaven and earth which makes up the fifth element,
or is rather the receptacle of the other four; and

the above fifth clement is denominated, by Sir Wil-

styled both in the Vcdas, and the works of the
Sufis.
