Boox 11. THE NATURE 01⁴* THINGS. 205

Turn from the path selected, baekwards urg'd,
Now here, now there, through ev’ry point propell’d.
Such the perplexing power of primal seeds.
From seeds all motion springs3 by impulse hence
Through molecules minute of seeds conjoin’d, 140
Nearest in power, protruded, though unseen.
Hence urg'd again, in turn, through things create
Of ampler form, till soon the sense itself
The congregated action marks distinct.
As in the lucid beam's light woof we trace 145

Still motion visual, though unseen its source.

Nor small the motive power ofprimal seeds.
This, MEMMms, should'st thou doubt, we thus confirm :
When first Aurora, o'er the dewy earth,
Spreads her soft light, and through the pathless grove 150
A thousand songsters ope their liquid throats‚

All ether charming—-sudden we survey

Ver. ¹52· —sudden we sur-vey Before the sun thou wast ς and at the voice
Th' fff'usive sun, as with α garment, decb Of God, as with a mantle didrt invest
With his own radiance, all created things ‚·] So The rising world. PAR. Losr, ii. 8.
Ps. civ. 1. 2.

θ Thomson has a similar invocation, and composed
Wxth glory and majest& art thou clothed; of similar imagery :

Thou art covered with light as with a garment. prime cheam Light ¹

This parallelism of imagery between the Hebrew Of a11 material beings first and best!

and the Roman bard, is as striking, as the imagery Efflux divine ξ Nature’s resplendent robe!

itself is bold and appropriate. Without whose vesting beauty, all were wrapt

It is thus imitated by Milton, in his address to In unessential gloom!
Light: Summa, 90.
