DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. ΙΙΙ,

At neque seorsum oculei, neque nareS‚ nec manus ipsa

Esse potest animfi, neque seorsum lingua3 neque aures

Auditum per se possunt sentire, neque esse.

Et, quoniam toto sentimus corpore inesse

Vitalem sensum, et totum esse animale videmus;

Si subito medium celeri praeciderit ictu

Vis aliqua, ut seorsum partem secernat utramque,

Dispartita procul dubio quoque vis animai,

Et discissa simul cum corpore,

At, quod scinditur, et parteis discedit in ullas,

disicietur.

Scilicet aeternam sibi naturam abnuit esse.

Falciferos memorant currus abscidere membra

times, is the same with many of those of the present
day. So, Milton, respecting the aug-elic essences:

——and food alike those pure
Intelligential substances require
As doth your rational; and both contain ’
within them every lower faculty
Ofsense‚xvhe1‘ebytheyhear‚ see, smell, touch‚tastc,
Tasdng, concoct, digest, assimilate,
And incorporeal to corporeal turn.

It was on this account, Mr. Locke cericeis-ed,
as I have already observed in the note on ver. 100 of
the present book, that even angels, as well as bea-
tified spirits, were compoundcd of matter: and Des
Car-tes, the most strict and rational immaterialist of
his age, supposed the disembodied spirit to be sur-
rounded with a light attenuate vehicle. So, Ges-
ner, in his representation of the ascension of Abel,
after the fratricide of Cain: Dcr Todesengel rief
itz Abels secie aus ihren blutendenh'ulle. Himm-
lisch lichelnd trat sie hervor, die geistigtcn theile des
co'rpers flosscn ihr nach : und mit balsamischen diiften

vermis-chet, διε. “ The angel of death called forth
the soul of Abel from its veil of blood. Smih'ng, it
advanced. The more spiritual parts of the body
ssew with it, and, mixing with the balsamic exhala-
tious, which the gentle winds wasted from the flow-
ers which blossomed within the circle of glory that
streamcd around the angel, environed the rising spi-
rit, and wove for it an etherial body.’' In a man-
ner perfectly similar, Klopstock delineates the ap-
pearance of the angel Gabriel himself, when descend-

ing to the altar of the earth:

ein schwebendcr leib, aus heitre gebildet‚
Hiillte den seligen geist in eine verklartere woh-
nung.

 

A fluent frame of clear, transparent light
Veii’d the saint spirit in his radiant flight.

But all such kind of necessary material investitum
proves the soul itself to be material, or, at least, in-
compctcnt to subsist without matter, and, of course,
as Lucretius juztly observes, to be of the same sub-
