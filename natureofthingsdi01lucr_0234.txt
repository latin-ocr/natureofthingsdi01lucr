DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. 1.

Ne forte haec per se cogant nos EssE fateri ;

Quando ea secla hominum, quorum haec eventa fuerunt,

Inrevocabilis abstulerit jam praeterita aetas.

Namque aliud terris, aliud legionibus ipsis,

Eventum dici poterit, quodquomque erit actum.

Denique, materies si rerum nulla fuisset,

Nec locus, ac spatium, res in quo quaeque geruntur3

Numquam, Tyndaridis formae conflatus amore,

Ignis, Alexandri Phrygio sub pectore gliscens,

whose form have been represented bypoets and histo-
rians as perfect and unrivaHed, and whose very name,
derived probably from ελω (traho, pertrahe), implies se-
duction, is fabulously reported to have been the daugh-
ter of Leda by Jupiter. Theseus, we are told, eloped

with her ere she had completed her tenth year: she was -

overtaken. howevt > , before she appears to have reach-
ed the Gretna Green of Goeece, by her brothers
Castor and Pollux, and rescued from the hands of her
unfortunate lover. At a more mature and proper age
she received the addresses of Menelaus, king of Spar-
ta, and was married to him. It was not long after-
wards that the elegant Paris, son of Priarn king of
Troy, was presented to her at the Spartan court;
and she consented to a second elopement. The Spar-
tan monarch followed her, but in vain ς and, stung by
revengc and disappointed love, he excited the Gre-
rian states to declare war against Priam, for the
countenance he seemed to afford his voluptnous son.
The war, as every one knows, terminated in the sub-
version of Troy, and the destruction of Priam and
his family. The wooden horse or machine, by which
the utter ruin of this celebrated city was 'accom-
plishcd‚ with every attendant circumstance, is inimi-
tably related by Vir-gil in his AEncid, b. ii. and Ho-
mer, in his Odyssey, b. 4.

Ver. 517. or thesalqu Tuom] Had Lucre-
tius been a writer of the present day, he must have
sought for other examples than those he has now ad-

 

duced, or the fastidious pen of some modern critics
would have been levelltd against him. Le Bossu‚ in
his Essay on the Epic, and Mr. Bryant, in an express
Dissertation on the subject, and with a gigantic mass of
eruditiori, have attempted to prove that there never was
such a place as Troy, or at least on theplain osllium ;
and of course that the history our poet refers to never
had an existence of any kind, either dependent or in-
dependent : and that the whole story of the Trojan
war is a fable invented by Homer, and unfounded in
fact. Their arguments arc principally derived from
the difficulty of determining the spot where, accord·
ing to the geographie description of Homer, the
city of Troy must have been erected‚ if it had ever
been erected at all ; from the very different situations
in which different critics have placed it ; from the en-
tire want of all traces and remains of this celebrated
city even in the time of Lucan 3 and from the uncer-
tainty of intelliffice possesed by the Greeks them-
selves prior to their olympiads, which did not com-
mence till some centuries after the supposed conquest

of Troy.
