philosopher who existed as late as the l6th century, and was a strong
champion for the eternity of matter. The works of ano, from which
I shall occasionally offer extracts, were dedicated to our own well-known
countryman, Sir Philip Sydney. England, indeed, had afforded him
an asylum from the persecutions of bigots and enthusiasts on the Con-
tinent; and, from a. variety of complimentary canzonets, which he

it seems, was a gallant and a poet, as well as a philosopher, he ac-

But none of these appear to have been, strictly speaking, ofthe Epi-

Abelard, and liis inveterate antagonist Champeaux, notwithstanding
the high reputation he acquired in consequence of his triumph over
him. Champeaux was accused of believing the Deity material, or, in
the language of Bayle, of disguised Spinosism (Spinozeme non de-
