THE NATURE OF THINGS.

When round the boy divine, in arms they danc’d‚

Boys still themselves, and beat to measur’d sounds

Their clashing shields, lest SATURN the shrill shriek

650

should trace, and RHAEA shed eterna] tears.

Thus these the marton-goddess now precede:

Or else, perchance, they paint how ev'ry breast

Should burn with patriot fire,

Prove the firm guardian of a parent’s years.

and ev'ry arm

All these, though pageants well-devis'd, and bold,

Wide wander still from philosophie fact.

For, far from mortals‚ and their vain concerns,

In peace perpetual dwell th’ immortal gods:

country of Latium, and the retreat of Adam from
the presence of the Altnighty in the garden of Eden.
De Philosoph. cap. vi. Cicero, however, gives us
a very different. derivation of the term Saturn; and
endeavours, at the same time, to account for the ro-
mantic story of his eating his own children. ‘⁸ He
was denominated Saturn,” observes hc, ‘⁶ from his
extreme age-his having been saturated with years.
He is represented as having been accustomed to de—
vour his som, because time consumes the different
spaces of months and years; and though filled with
the ages that are elapsed already, continues still insa-
tiable.’' Saturnus appellatus est quod saturetur annis,
&c- de Nat. Deor. l. ii. The preceding note offers

however, if I mistake not, a much happier allegory.

These six verses are to be found, without any al-
teration, in Book 1. 57, and following : in the note

reans never meant to exclude the existence of beings

superior to man both in rank and happiness; be-
ings whom they denominat-sd and regarded as
gods, but whose faculties were incapable, either of
creafing, or governing the universe; and who were
themselves dependent upon the supreme cause of all
things. These exalted spirits seem to have constituted,
in the Epicurean enred, what the order of angels con-
stitute in the Christian, only with thisssdifferencm that
the latter, though perfectly happy, and exempt from
cares and sorrows, are constantly engaged in the su-
pei-intendence of the moral world. ‘⁵ Ne se peut-il
point,'' says Leibnitz‚ “ qu’il y a un grand espace
au dela de la region des etoiles? Qe se soit le ciel
empyree ou non, toujours 'cet espace immense qui
environne toute cette region pourra cti-e rempli de
bonheur et de gloire. ll pourra etre concu comme
l'ocean, οὐ se rendent les fleuves de toutesles creatur-es
bien heureuses, quand elles seront venues a leur pcr-
fection dans le systeme des etoiles.’' Theod. p. i. 19.

XVithout translating this passage, I shall give the
verses of Akenside upon it, who denominates this
seat of felicity‚ and, probably, with a reference to
Lucretius as well as to Leibnitz :
