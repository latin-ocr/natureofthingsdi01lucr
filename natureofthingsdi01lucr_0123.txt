from different combinations of which every individual being is created.
These existences have no property iu common with each other; for,
whatever matter is, that space is the reverse of, and whatever space is,
matter is the contrary to. The actually solid parts of all bodies, there-
fore, are inatter; their actual poreS, space, 'and the· parts which are
not altogether solid, but an intermixture of solidity and pore, are space
and matter combined. Anterior to the formation of the universe,
space and matter existed uncmnbined, or in their pure and elementary
state. Space, in its elementary state, is positive and unsolid void:
matter, in its elementary state, consists of ineonccivably minute seeds
or atoms--so small that the corpuscles of vapour, light, and heat, are
eompounds of them ; and so solid that they cannot possibly be broken,
οι· made smaller, by any concussion or violence whatever. The express
figure of these primary atonis is various: there are round, square,
pointed, jagged, as well as many other shapeS. These shapes, how-
ever, are not diversified to infinity3 but the atonis themselves, of each
existent shape, are infinite or innumerablc. Every atoni is possessed
of certain intrinsic powers of motion. Under the old school of De—
mocritus, the perpetual motions exhibited were of two kinds :-—a de-
scending motion, from its own gravity3 and a rebounding motion, from
mutual concussion. Besides these two motions, and to explain certain
phaenomena which the following poem developes, and which were not
accounted for under the old system, Epicurus supposed that some
atoms were occasionally possessed ofa third, by which, in some very
small degree, they desc-ended in an oblique or curvilinear direction,
deviating from the common and right line anomalously; and hence, in
this respect, resembling the oscillations of the magnetic needle.

These infinitudes of atoms, flying immemorially in such different di-
rections, through all the immensity of space, have interehangeably
tried and exhibited every possible mode of aedom—sometimes repelled
