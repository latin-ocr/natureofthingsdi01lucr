Ver. 767. the pond'rous marm] Pherecydes,
the tutor of Pythagoras, is said to have taught the
existence of three eternal beings, Jupiter, Time, and
Eat-th3 and to have believed that all material exist-
ences were derived from the last. Hesiod, however,
coneeived Earth to be the only eternal substance and
clement, and that Jupiter himself, as well as all the
other gods, and the whole family of mortals, were
produced by Earth, and out of its own primitive sub-
stance. Barnardin‚ Telesius, and some other phil&-
sophers of later periods, have indulged conjectures
not very dissimilar. Employing the term generally
as a whole, and not singly as an clement, our poet
himself regards the earth as the source of all being,
animate and inanimate: thus a few lines further, he
asserts,

Mate-mal, hence, is earth most justly named :

and the same observation is repeatedly made in b. v.
where the doctrine of cosmology is discussed at full
length. Eut in none of these instances does he re·
gard the earth as a separate clement 3 consequently,
he deviates essentially from those writers, whether
philosophers or mythologistS‚ who contend for such
an clement, and trace the origin of all things from
this individual elemeut alone. It was from earth, as an
dement of this kind, that the Titans or giants of an-
cient tradition were conceived to have arisen. Thus
Herodotus, μυθολο) ουνται 3³ ὸι ramim,- Γηγεμεις γεγονεναι,
ὗια την ὑπερέἷσλην ’του κατα το σ’ωμα, μεγεθους, “ They as-
serted in their fables‚ that the giants were produced
from the earth, on account of the excessive dimen-

sions of their bodies? And it js obvious that the

terms, 1⁴³7²5 and Γηγενης, Giant and Earth-born, are
nearly equivalent ; the former having probably origi—
nated from the latter. In consequence of this prodi·
gious size, they were compared to mountains or ele·
vations, on which the sun first threw his earliest
beams; and the term Titans‚ by which they were
denominat-ed, has no other meaning. Hence Mr.
Allwood contenda, but I think unwarrantably, that
the Titans were mere temples or mountains dedicated
to the sun, and never had any real existence.

with rins] As the individual elements have
occasionally found supporters among the Greek phi-
losopherS, so have they at times in every variety of
combination. OEnopides pretended to trace the rise
of au things from an union of air and ἦγες Xeno-
phanes, from an union of earth and water; Parmeni-
des, from that of earth and fire ς and Hippo of Rhe-
gium, from that of fire and water ς whilst Onomacri-
tus, and, since his era, Deseartes, and his diseiples,
admit three out of the four vulgar elements, the for-

mer rejecting air, and the latter fire.

Whilst I am upon this subject, I ought not to pass
over the theory of that learned and acute geologist,
the late Mr. VVhitehursss which has again been
brought foravards and improved upon by Mr. Kir-
wan. Mt, VVhitehurst supposes the whole planetary
system to have been formed at the same instant ; and
that the earth, as well as the rest of the planas, was
originally a large undivided pulp or chaos, uniformly
suspended in this fluid state. He supposes, more-
