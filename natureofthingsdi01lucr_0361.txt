Boox II. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 213

No power divine this mass material rear'd 18 ς
With ills so pregnant. This, in order due,
The muse shall full demonstrate: turn We now
To what of motion yet remains unsung.

And here, O Memmius! mark this precept well;
That nought corporeal, of itselfi can e'er 190
Ascend sublime through regions urg'cl above.
Nor let th' aspiring flame, with specious boast‚
Heedless deceive thee. True, with upward ssight,
E’en from the first, its spreading spires unfold3 195
And fruitS, and plants their growth still upwards urge.
Yet as the weight by all possest, below
Drives all things, deem not thou, when the bright blaze
Flames through th’ affrighted house, the crackling roof
Tumbling precipitate‚ then deem not thou 200
It mounts spontaneous but from foreign force.
Thus, from the wounded vein, the vital blood
Ascends, and pours its purple strength sublime:

And springs not thus the pond' rous trunk 1mmers ’d

Injice suber aquis immergens, injice ligna3 Plunge cork, plunge timber through th' clastic
Ligna petent summum valido connisa natatu, wave ε
Prosiliet superas celeri impetu suber ad undas. Back bounds the timber, resolute to swim,
Causa rei quaenam est ἒ nimirum liquor aquas While the light cork, still loffler, tops the
Fertur in ima magis >quam lignum aut futile tide !

suber t Whence this effect ἓ hence clearly, that the wave
Libramen simul omne petit ; depulsaque quantum Is urg-’d still deeper than the cork or trunk;
Unde sua superat gravitate haee corpora, tantum That all things claim their level ; and that, hence,
Debilitant liquidam, cui sunt commissa colum· As much as o’er such buoyant forms the stream

nam. lib. 4. Triumphs in might, themselves the stream divide.
