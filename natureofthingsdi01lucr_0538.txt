DE RERUM NATURA.

The following idea of Moliere is perfectly parallel,
and his advice, when applied to the subject before
us, is well worth attending to.

Consulte ta raison, prens sa clam? pour guide,
voi si de tes sonpcons l'apparence est solide ;
Ne demens pas leur voix.
D. Gaacoe de NAVARRE, Act ii.

Consult thy reason ; be her lamp thy guide ;
Weigh well thy views; let reason still decide;
Her voice abjure not.

pride of the most confident philosopher, if it be
not deemed libellous to the character of a philoso-
pher to conceive that he can be confident, to re.
flect on the very little he knows, after all his reading
and researches, of the substance that constitutes the
existence, either of himself, or of external objects.
h'latter, even in its simplest form, inactive as it may
appear to be, is the most fugitive thing imaginable :
and, although the atomic system, which reduces the
whole to primordial and extreme corpuscles, equally
devoid of all properties but those of solidity and mo-
tion, and which conceives, that all compound bodies
whatsoever‚ are but different combinations of such
corpuscles‚—be most consistent with the experiments
of modern chemistry, and form a grand principle in
the Newtonian theory—yet, when we have ndvanced
thus far in our researches, we are but upon the
threshold of natural philosophy ς a thousand phaeno-

investigations into the external world3 it cannot be
a matter of surprise, that when we ascend higher‚
und endeavour to develop the world of sensation and
thought,-to unlock its secret springs, and ttace its
delicate dependencies, we should be still inore sub-
ject to miscarssage, dis.1greerneiit and error. One

general conclusion however, it becomes us to draw
from our discrepance and ill-soccesffi and that is, to
entertain a generous and liberal complacency for the
presumptions and conjectures of each other.

Lucretius, who has endeavoured to demonstrate
in the last book, v. 873.

That all the sentient forms the sight surveys,
Whate’er their powers, from senseless atoms
spring,

now enters upon the great business of applying this
axiom to the peculiar constitution of man; hereby
maintaining‚ that the human soul‚ or principle of
vitality and thought, is as purely material, as essen-
tially derived from simple primordial corpuscles, as
any other part of him. This he undertakes to prove
in a series of twenty-eight arguments, extending
from the present passage to v. 8 58 of the book be-
fore us: after which he deduces from such an esta-
blished doctrine a variety of moral reflectione, which,
in point of wisdom, sublimity‚ and poetic excel-
lence, never have been surpassed by any poet or phi-
losopher whatever; and which are possessed of this
peculiar advantage, that they are of universal appli-
cation, let our system of ethics or religion be what
it may. Respecting all these arguments, however,
Frachetta has most illiberally declared, in his Ex—
posifion, sono in guisa redicula, che non porta il
preggio di rigittarle—-“ they are, in themselves, so
ridiculous‚ as not to be worth the expence of refuting
them.” But he nevertheless attempts a refutation‚
and proves the absurdity of so general and dogmatic
an asser-tion, by completely failing, if I be not mis-
taken‚ in the whole of his attempt.

In pursuing the scope of his inquiry, our philoso-
phie poet first endeavours to develop the substance of
the soul ; secondly‚ its more immediate seat, or pre-
sence-chamber; and, thirffly, its durability: and it
may be of use to the reader, previous to his enter-ing
into the general detail ofthis important subject, to be
made acquainted‚ by as brief a sketch as possible,
with its leading ideas and dependencies.
