In their attempts to establish scientific propositions ancient inquirers
were fit a great disadvantage, since they were unable to verify their doctrines
either by experiment or by very extensive observations. Yet the Epicureans,
working on the lines laid down by Leucippus and Democritus, contrived to
anticipate with more or less definiteness some very important results
of modern research. Lucretius reaches, for instance, that atoms are
indestructible3 and he makes good his position by an argument which,
so far as it goes, is perfectly sound. This argument is that matter
obeys unchanging laws, and that it could not do so is its ultimate
elements were in course of time either worn or broken by use.
Again, he maintains that atoms are not all of the same kind, but
vary in size, in shape, and eonsequently in weight—a theory which was
destined to do splendid service, for it was the principle which enabled
Dalton to give coherence to those laws ot combining proportion by which
he revolutionized chemistry. Other remarkable deductions were that atoms
are continually in motion, even when they are grouped in solid matter3 that
they have always moved, and always will move, with the same velocity3 and
that motion is the only ultimate form of energy. Mr. Masson even thinks that
Lucretius had some perception of chemical affinity; butthe only evidence sor
this is that he applies the word ‘⁸ concilium ” to any combination of atoms hy
