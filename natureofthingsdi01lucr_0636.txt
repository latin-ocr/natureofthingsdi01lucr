alone that he supposes the multitude by whom he is
surrounded to be his senous, and possessed of sensa-

by a brute, he has the same reason sor supposing him

any intelligent beingfexcepting his own individual
person ς and the scepticisrn of Pyrrho, or the idealism
of Berklcy or Home, is immediately introduced,
which is the very reverse of what Polignac designed.

The CardinaL secondly‚ proceeds to assert‚ that
we have as much reason for absurdly admitting the
existence of a percipient soul in vegetables and mi-
net-als, as in hintes, since many classes of both these
kingdoms 3?oe evident externat signs of internal pas-
sion or commotion3 and particularly the mimosa
(herba mannmfizgiens, a scnsu nomen adepta) and the
magnet. But this is evidently affirming too much
for his own purpose. For we hare no more rea-
son to conclude, ἂ priori, that matter in any state
of cornbination could exhibit the propertics of the
magnet, the miniosa, ωι- the brute creation, than that
it could produce the phaenomena of intelligence. And
it is principally from caresul and repeated observa-
tiou os the former, that Lucretius, Locke, and
every modern materialist, deduces his belief of the
possibility of the latter. In reply to the question,
therefore, which seems naturally to ensne, why may
not the substance that is capable of producing fossil
amat-tion, vegetable irritability‚ and brutal instinct
and sensatico, be competent to the production of
human intelligence ἲ The Cardinal,

Thirdly, adcances a step farther, and hardily as-
serts, ver. (οἳ, that tlntrt is no such thing as attrac-
tion, irritability‚ instinct, or sensation, in any combi-

nation of matter whatsoever z and that brute-t, planta,
aad fossils‚ are all equally autom-amns, beings alike
devoid of voluntary action, and alone impelled by
foreign stimulus. And that, as the arrow which
flies froin the bow does not quit it from a sense of
hatred or fear, nor strike and wound the object.
against which it is directed, from the possession of
anger : so, without any passion of his own, the dog
pin-sues the wolf, or engages in the act of conen<
piscence. As to the doctrine of physical attraction‚
Descartes imagined he avoided its necessity, by em-
bracing tha—t of an absolute plenum; upon which I
have already observed, in various notes on book the
first of this poem. As to sensation, he contended that
it could only bc the property of an intelligent being}
while, with regard to instinct, the cardinal, pursuing
the dictates of his master, observes, ver. 1145, that
the ocean, which renews its tide at definite and al-
ternate periods, has just as much of it as any brute
whatever. “ vWhat‚'’ inquires he, “ is meant by
this vulgar and empty term instinct ? Is it mind, oris
it not ? If not, then is there nothing existing but a
mere machine? lf it be mind, is it a mind residing
within the body of the brute, or exterior to it? lf
the latter, it is the universal Mind, or great First
Cause of all things, acting by impulse, and the brute
is a mere machine still : if the former, yet must this
instinctive principle differ widely from the principle
of human intelligence, since it endows its possessor
with a fixed degree of instantaneous knowledge, nei-
ther capable of increase, nor acquired by a long
course of habit and education. To support such a
theory,'‘ he tells uS, “ is not to establish the creed of
material intellig-enee, but to recal to our aid the me·
tempsychosis of Pythagoras and the Gymnosophists,
and to believe that every existent brute is inhabited by
a genius or spirit, immortal in its nature, and which is
perpetually transmigrating from body to body. A
beliefss’ continues the Cardinal‚ ver. 1214—1254‚
“ which, however extraordinary and unauffiorized, is
certainly much more consistent and tolerable than
the creed, which maintains the productiori of percep-
