THE NATURE OF THINGS.·

109

The silver sounds that charm th’ enchanted ear.

But whence, I ask, if all from FIRE proceed

Unmix’d and simple, spring created things

So various in their natures ? Urge not here

705

That fire condenses now, and now expands3

For if the same, divided or entire,

Its parts condens'd‘a] heat can only prove

More fierce ; and less when rarefied, and thin.

Still all is FIRE.

Nor canst thou e'er conceive

710

From fire that aught can spring but fire itself.

Much less, in fire made dense alone, or rare,

Trace the vast variance of created things.

Dense too, and rare a vacuum must imply,

As urg'd already x yet full well convinc'd

715,

What straits surround them if a void exist,

yet Heraclitus, and his followers, deny a vacuum,
and therefore ought to deny the possibility of rare-
factiom for which they contend. if, however, it
could be imagined that the particles of fire change
their very nature by uniting together, when once a
change of any kind has taken place, and the original
nature of the substance is hereby destroyed, it must
continue to change, it must pei-severe in wasting‚ till
at length it perish altogether. Undoubtedly, there
are substances in nature which are perfectly immuta-
ble, the essential seeds of whatever exists, and a
change in the quantity or arrangement of which pro-
duces that variety which surrounds us ; but it is certain
that these primal seeds or substances cannot be fire,
for then every thing would be tire, and there could

be no variety whatever: while, to maintain such a ’

theory, moreover‚ would be to oppose our system to
7

our senses; our mental conjectures to those organs,
whence all knowledge of facts and events must of ne-
cessity flow: nor is there any superior reason for a
denial of the existence of other supposed elements in
favour of fire, rather than for a denial of fire in fa-
vour of the existence of other supposed elements.

Thatfire condfnses now, and now expandi· ;]
Diogenes Laertius, in his life of Heraclitus, informs
us of the order by which the adherents to this hypo-
thesis imagined all things were produced from fire.
Fire, says he, according to their opinion, when con-
densed, becomes moist, and thus is changed to air 3 «
air, by compression, becomes water: and water,
when condensed, becomes earth. See note on ver.
