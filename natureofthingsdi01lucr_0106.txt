xcii THE LIFE OF LUCRETIUS‘

that the hound has no more will of his own in ehasing the fox 01· the haro,
than the wires of ,a harpsichord have in theexcitation of tenes ; and that,
as the latter is mechanieally thrown into action by the pressure of the

fingers upon the keys, so the hound is mechanically driven forwards by
the pressure of the stimulating odour that exli-ales from the body of the
fox or hare upon his nostrils '⁸⁶- Such are the fancies which have been
invented, to explain what appears to elude all explanation whatever,

and, eonsequently, to prove that the original theory itself is unfounded.

Yet the objections that apply to the theory of materhrlism, as com-
monly understood and professed‚ are still greater. By the denial of en
intermediate state of being between the two periods of death and the
resurrection of the body, it opposes what appears to be, not only the
general tenor, but, in some instances, the direct declarations of the
¹Christian 'Scripturesviw and by conceiving the entire dissolution and
dispersion of the animal machine, of which all the atoms may become

afterwards constituent portions of other intelligent beings, it renders a
future and resumed personality ahnost, if not altogether, impossible.

The idea I have thrown out seems to avoid the difficulties· attached to
both systems. It says to the materialist, matter is not necessarily cor-
ruptible : you admit that it is not 50, 11ρο11 your own principle, which
strenuously asserts, that the body itself will, hereafter, arise incorrup-
tible and immutable. It says to the immaterialist, the term immaterial
is the mere creature of system, at the same time that it by no means an-
swers the purpose of its creation : it tells him that it is a term not to be
found in the scriptures, which, so far from discountenancing a belief that
the soul‚ spirit, or immortal part of man, is a system of gaseous or ethe-
rial matter, seem rather to authorize such a conception by expressly
