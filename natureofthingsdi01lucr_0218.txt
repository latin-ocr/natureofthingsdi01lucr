DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. 1.

Omnia natura& namque est in rebus 1NANE:

Quod tibi cognosse in multis erit utile rebus;

Nec sinet errantem dubitare, et quaerere semper

De summa rerum, et nostris diffidere dictis.

[Quapropter locus est intactus inane, vacansque]

335

Quod, si non esset, nulla ratione moveri

Res possent3 namque, obficium quod corporis exstat,

Obficere atque obstare, id in omni tempore adesset

Ver. 376. Smrch where thou wilt, an iucoxrouaz‘
voum] The poet, in these verses, advauces an-

other axiom or principle of the Epicurean school. He ,

has already established the existence and imperishabi·
lity of solid bodies ; and he now endeavours to demon-
strate the existence of a void or space in which such
bodies interact. These tei-ms, space and void, and
sometimes region, are, therefore, used in the prose·
cution of his observations, synonymously, and to gra-
tify the ear with a rich interchange of expressions.
This existence in the physical world, observes Em-
piricus, is denominated a void or vacuum, because it is
destitute of hodm a space, because it contains bodie33
and a regi-m, because bodies are movedin it.

The principle here admnced, the poet endeavours
to establish by four beautiful and cogent illustrations;
and which, with liis casual reply to objections that
had frequently been urged by other writers, extend
to verse 479.—If there be no vacuum, or incorporeal
space, the unive1se would be all and equally solid—
and nothing could possibly move, because nothing
conld possibly give way to admit of motion. But
even the common appcamnces of things convince us,
in a vast variety of instances‚ that substances deemed
the most solid and compact, are, nevertheless‚ posses-
sed of some degree of vacuum. Were this not a
fact, were all bodies equally solid and compact,
every thing would be possessed of an equ-al weight.
And with whatever speed the space, existing between
the parts of bodies separated abruptly and by force,

may be filled with air, prior to the arrival of such
air there must have been a complete vacuum.

The Cardinal Polignac, who was a strong adherent
to every doctrine of the Cartesian school, excepting,
indeed, its vortices, has devoted almost the whole of
the second book of his Anti-Lucretius to the con-
sideration of this subject, and to the entire denial of
all vacuum whatever.

The arguments of Lucretius, as well as those of
more modern philosophers, as Spinosa, Gassendi, and
Newton, pass in review before him, and he contro·
verts them with no small dexterity3 whilst he ad-
vances opposite arguments to support the Cartesian
system ofa plenum. Space, he observes, from the
properties attributed to it by Lucretius, is, in reality,
a God. For, if space be immutable and infinite, there
is no reason why it should not be intelligent and al-
mighty.--1f‚ moreover, it be divisible‚ and by such
division, admit bodies to pass through it, it cannot
be infinite.—In this case, too, it must be composed of
parts, and consequently corporeal. But that which
is pure vacuum cannot be corporeal. vacant space,
therefore, is a mere chimera of the imaginationg a
thing that can have no real existence. But I must
refer the reader, for further information, to the poem
itself; as I must also to the works of Bayle, Euler,
and other Anti-Cartesians, for the ratiocination by
which this specious mcide of arguing has been coma
pletcly subverted.
