THE

LIFE

OF

,LUCRETIUS

CoNcnaNING this inimitable poet, and most excellent philosopher.
History presents us but with few authentic documents: and hence
there are many circumstances of his life upon which writers have not
been able to agree. For this dearth of materials, it is not difficult to
account. Lucretius lived and died in a period in which the eye ot'
every citizen was directed to public concerns ; when the Roman
empire was distracted by the ambition of aspiring demagogues‚ and
the jealousies of contending factions: and when the party that tri-
umphed in the morning was often completely defeated by night.
Added to which, the life of Lucretius was spent in the shades of
philosophy and quiet: a situation, undoubtedly, best calculated for
the improvement of the heart, and the cultivation of philosophy or
the muses, yet little checquered with those lights and shades‚' with
that perpetual recurrence of incident, and contrast of success and
misfortune, which are often to be met with in the lives of the nmrc
active; and which importunately call for the pen of the biographer.
