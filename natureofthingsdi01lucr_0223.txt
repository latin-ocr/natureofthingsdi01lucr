THE NATURE oF THINGS.

Of matter each contain’d‚ alike the weight

Would prove perpetual: for, from matter sole,

F lows weight, and moment, ever prone to earth:

While vacant space nor weight nor moment knows.

Where things surpoise, then, though of equal bulk,

There MATTER most resides: but where ascends

The bearn sublime, the rising substance holds

A smaller share, and larger leaves the vom.

Hence draws the sage his creed: in all produc'd

Finds vacuum still, and calls that vacuum SPACE.

But some there are such doctrines who deny:

And urge in proof, deceptive, that the wave

Compare this axiom with that proposed by Lu-
cretius, commencing with an interrogation at verae
403, aud continued to verse 420.

Say why of equal bulk, in equal scale,

Are things oft found unequal in their poise?
O'er the light wool the grosser lead prevails
With giant force, &c.

For other instances, see the note that immediately
follows; that on v. 510, v. 536, and v. 1028.

Ver. 419. And urge in procff, dec-eplive, that the
wave, ἔθα] There may be a plenum, ob-

serves Des Cartes, but motion may, nevertheless‚ com-
mence and continue ε “ every part of matter that is
moved (to copy from the abstract of his doctrine on
this subject, as given by the late ingenious Adam
Smith) thrusting some other out of its place, and
that some other still, and so on. But, {to avoid an
infinite progress, and harmonize with his own vor-
tices, he supposed that the matter which any body
pushed before it, rolled immediately backwards to
supply the place of that matter which flowed in be-

hind it : as we may observe in the swimmt'ng ofa fish‚
that the water, which it pushes before it, immediately
rolls backward5 to supply the place,of what flows in be-
hind it ,- and thus forms α small circle, or vortex, round

the body of the fish.’ ' Essays on Philosophical Sub-
jeets.

Whether or not Des Cartes knew at the time he
adopted this illustration of his doctrine, he was only
repeating what had been long advanced before, and
what, in the verses in question, is admirably refuted

by Lucretius, 1 cannot tell. But the Cardinal Po· ν

lignem, notwithstanding this refutation of our poet,
still chose to continue the same plausible, but un-
founded, illustration, in his Anti-Lucretius, though
he waswell acquainted with the reply that was already
prepared for him. Anti-Lucr. lib. ii. 673.

Rem res dum pellit, quaeris quo pulsa recedit, Sec.

Sir Richard Blackmore has borrowed the same

image from our poet; but in opposition to the phi—
losophy of Aristotle. Creation, b. i.

Nor could the fish divide the stffn'dfloods.
