velope ἦ) and yet, whatever may have been the immediate arms with
which Abelard encountcred this heterodox son of the church, we are
told that, on other occasions, he himself never hesitated to assert, that
‘⁶ God is all thingS, and all things are God ; that he is convertible into
all things, and all things are convertible into hi1n3 imitating, in this
respect, the theosophy of Empedocles or Anaxagoras, and distinguish-
ing the species of things according to their simple appearance ἦθ’.

Abelard was therefore ranked,—and certainly considered asan atomist,
with much more reason than many of the rest, whose namesIhave glanced
at,—among the scholars of Epicurus: and Arnobius, of whose abilities
Du Pin gives us no very favourable opinion ss, Hierocles, the subtle and
celebrated Thomas Aquinas, Duns Scotus, and an almost infinite nurn-
ber of other combatants of equal ability, were, srorn age to age, en-
gaged in subverting the doctrines of these irnaginary Epicureans.

Shortly after the revival of letters, however, and especially about the
15th century, notwithstanding the superiority which Aristotle still con-

ofprofessed schools, the doctrines of Epicurus began, once more, to
obtain a warm, and, in some measure, a fashionable encouragement.

‡ Arnobius pretended to have been called to the profession of the Christian saith by his dreams. The
bishops obliged him to give some proof of his attachment to their own religion, and he composed a work
in seven or eight Books, entitled ‘⁴ Adversus Gentes.'' This publication I have never had an opportu-
nity of perusing3 but Du Pin informs us, that it was written with much haste, and that he appears to
have been but little acquaiuted with the mysteries of the Christian saith. ‘⁶ 11 artaque‚'' observes he,
