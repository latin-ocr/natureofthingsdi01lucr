This crustaceous coating is dccided by Mr.
Hatchett, to consist of a strong cartilage, hardened
by a mixture of carbonat, and phosphat of lime, in
consequence of which, it occupies a middle place
between shell and bone, although principally in-
clining to the nature of shell; the distinguishing
chemical character of which is carbonat of lime3
while that of bone, as well as of the enamel of the
teeth‚is phosphat of lime. Philos. Trans. for 1800.

Ver. 625. Or, like the stag his antlers‚-—] Pliny
confirms this phaenomenon of our poet, by observing,
that “the males have horns, and are the only ani-

mals that lose them every year, at a certain period
of the spring.’' Hist. Nat. cap. xxxii. And our
own poet Waller alludes to the same fact, in the fol-

lowing verses :

So we some antique hero’s strength
Learn by his lance’s weight, and length ;
As these vast beams express the beast
Whose shady brows alive they dress’d.

O fertile head ! which, ev'ry year,

Could such a crop of wonders bear!
Which, might it never have been cast,
Each year's growth added to the last,
These lofty branches had supplied

The earth’s bold sons' prodigious pride3
Heav’n with these engines had been sdal’d
When mountains heap’d on mountains fail’d.

See, upon the same subject, the preceding note.

‘These never gender ,Ρ ] The commentator
upon Creech’s translation, affirms the argument hence
deduced‚ to be both false and irrelevant. The soul,
contends Lucretius, is produced in one individual or-
gan, and is never found in any other situation.
“ But birds‚'’ says the commentator, “ are hatched
in a nest, and yet live out of the nest ς and a nut is
produced upon a tree, and a grain of corn in the ear,
and yet they are kept in granarie5.’' Yet what is
there in all thisto falsifyour poet's position?ls it hence
demonstrated‚ that “the mind is generated in the
hands or the feet,'' or that, in opposition to what our
poet urges in the succeeding verse, “each spot does not
exist for some fixt purpose „³” The whole that the
commentator has advanced, can only be advanced by
way of analogy,—and the most distant analogy t00;
for the resemblance, if minutely entered into, would
fail in a variety of important particular-s. ‘⁴ But the
poet,'’ adjoins he, “contradicts his own doctrine :'’
and, for the proof of this contradiction, we are re-
ferred to Book H. v. 1008 of this translation, where
he asserts,

Thus all things rise, thus all again return,

Earth takes what earth bestow'd‚ and, back to

hcav'n, γ’
Remount th’ etherial dews from heav’n that fell.

By some inexplicable error, this annotator ap-

pears to conceive, that Lucretius, in the lust verse,
refers to the mind or spirit, and that this would b:
